![](arrow.jpg){width="2.5%"} **My NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived since 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher education for 51 years.** ![](rarrow.jpeg){width="2.5%"}

![](arrow.jpg){width="2.5%"} **These NOTES span topics that reflect a range of ideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit at a table with my computers in front of the large windows that look over trees, birds, and daily neighborhood activities from my 4th-floor condo in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.** ![](rarrow.jpeg){width="2.5%"}
