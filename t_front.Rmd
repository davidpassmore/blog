My NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived since 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher education for 51 years.

These NOTES cover a wide variety of topics that reflect the range of ideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit with my computers at a table in front of the large windows that look over trees, birds, and daily neighborhood activities from our 4th-floor condo in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
