Powder metallurgy ([PM]{.smallcaps}) is a generic term that includes
techniques to produce solid metal-based products from powders. PM part
manufacturing (PMPM, or simply PM$^{2}$) is a process for forming metal
parts by sintering metal powders compacted in dies under pressure
[@pickpm2022]. "Sintering" is the process of heating the so-called
"green compact" metal powder that was die-pressed into shapes
[@rahaman2015]. Sintering heats green compact parts just below their
melting points in furnaces in controlled, gas-enriched atmospheres to
produce finished metal parts.

The history of applying PM$^{2}$ principles extends back as far as â‰ˆ3000
B.C.E. [@adams2015a], although commercial production of PM$^{2}$
accelerated in the late 1800s [@horizontechnology2019]. In 2022,
PM$^{2}$ is forecasted to account for only 6.5% of revenue generated by
the U.S. metal stamping and forging industry [@haupt2022, p. 18], of
which PM$^{2}$ is a part. However, PM$^{2}$ has been historically the
most profitable product segment of the metal stamping and forging
industry [@haupt2022a, p.12].

The PM$^{2}$ industry is a significant part of the history of the
economy and technology of Pennsylvania. PM$^{2}$ in the United States is
highly concentrated in the north-central region of Pennsylvania. The
history and performance of this concentration of PM$^{2}$ within a rural
Pennsylvania region offer an example of how a geographic cluster of
human, natural, technological, and capital resources can establish a
niche in the national economy and exert technical leadership globally.

As narrated in a historical account assembled by Atlas Pressed Metals
[-@atlaspressedmetals2022], north-central Pennsylvania PM$^{2}$ is
rooted in the late 1800s production of pressed carbon in St. Marys,
Pennsylvania, to make metal graphite brushes for the then-emerging
electric power industry. Carbon pressing techniques developed to make
these parts were transferred to making carbon electrodes for deployment
in electric arc steel furnaces in Pittsburgh. Then, inspired by porous
carbon bearings exhibited at the 1932 World's Fair in Chicago, carbon
producers began to explore the growing possibilities of PM$^{2}$ after
World War II. When employees of these companies gained experience, they
spawned their own companies for PM$^{2}$. As production expanded,
technology advanced, and PM$^{2}$ expertise clustered around St. Marys,
north-central Pennsylvania began branding itself as the "Powder
Metallurgy Capital of the World" (see, e.g., DeLillo [-@delulloiii2016];
St. Marys Chamber of Commerce [-@st.marysareachamberofcommerce2022]).

In the remainder of this posting, we review the scope and operations of
the PM$^{2}$ industry. First, we explain common processes for PM$^{2}$.
Next, resource and product markets for PM$^{2}$ are described. Then, we
analyze U.S. Census Bureau data to account for the dense concentration
of PM$^{2}$ in north-central Pennsylvania. Last, some forces affecting
PM$^{2}$ growth and change in the U.S. are considered.

Assembling this review was challenging. The PM$^{2}$ research literature
published in refereed journals focuses on physics, chemistry,
engineering, and metallurgy applications to PM$^{2}$ processes. Few
textbook resources are available about PM$^{2}$, primarily because
PM$^{2}$ receives scant attention in the education of engineers. For
instance, engineering students receive approximately one-half hour of
lecture devoted to PM$^{2}$ during their undergraduate experience at
Penn State. As a result, expertise in PM$^{2}$ often is acquired in
practice, sometimes by entrepreneurs and innovators without formal
engineering training.

Information about the organization, economics, and finances of PM$^{2}$
is provided primarily in industry market reports sitting behind
paywalls, in conference presentations, through audiovisual works, in
blogs posted on company websites, and in the literature distributed by
professional associations. To assemble our view of the scope and
operation of PM$^{2}$, we reviewed the extensive gray literature about
PM$^{2}$ and relied on discussion and advice received during interviews
and meetings with various PM$^{2}$ producers in north-central
Pennsylvania and through contacts we made with suppliers and customers
for PM$^{2}$.

## Processes

I synthesized a straightforward, coherent narrative about PM$^{2}$
processes from various online sources. Included among these sources is a
section about powder metallurgy provided in the Library of Manufacturing
[-@libraryofmanufacturing2022], in Summer School materials for the
European Powder Metallurgy Association (Arnhold [-@arnhold2017a]; Grande
[-@grande2016]; Whitaker [-@whitaker2008]; Zanon [-@zanon2017]), and in
company and professional association blogs and websites (among many: ISQ
Directory [-@isqdirectory2022]; MachineMaker [-@machinemaker2022];
Mechanicalland [-@mechanicalland2021]; Metal Powder Industries
Federation [-@metalpowderindustriesfederation2008]; PickPM
[-@pickpm2022a], [-@pickpm2022b], [-@pickpm2022c]; Powder Metallurgy
Review [-@powdermetallurgyreview2016]).

### Conventional Pressing

A process, diagrammed in Figure \@ref(fig:img-process), known as
press--and--sinter is the core, conventional PM$^{2}$ process. In this
process, custom--blended metal powders are fed into a die, compacted by
a punch into the desired part, ejected from the die, and then sintered
in a controlled atmosphere furnace at a temperature below the melting
point of the base material. Press--and--sinter processes offer
relatively low manufacturing and tooling costs and produce close
tolerances in the finished parts.

```{r img-process, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2, out.width="85%", out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Conventional powder metallurgy process* <br> (Image from Kumar & Xavior [-@kumar2018, Figure 2] available via Creative Commons license [@ccby3.a].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/powd/ConvPM.png")
```

General attributes of the PM$^{2}$ process include elimination or
minimization of machining; reduction of scrap and waste due to "net
shape" processes; close dimensional tolerances; relatively low energy
use (e.g., metal need not be melted); and ability to produce complex
shapes (examples of parts in Figure \@ref(fig:img-part)). However, to
eject the pressed green compact part from the die requires certain part
design constraints. For instance, parts with undercuts, grooves,
threads, knurls, reverse tapers, or orifices at angles to the direction
of pressing are ill-suited for PM$^{2}$. Also, a green compact part
resembles the greenware stage of ceramics production because the part
ejected from the die has just enough structural integrity to be handled
and transported. As a result, part design is essential. For instance,
sufficient radii of inner and outer flanges and the overall thickness of
parts are required to maintain the integrity of a green compact part
before sintering. Gear design for PM$^{2}$ is another example of a
design constraint. An adequate modulus of gear teeth is necessary to
allow powder to fill a die and to maintain sturdiness before sintering,
Refer to PickPM [-@pickpm2022d] and Penafiel [-@penafiel2017] for
additional design considerations.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/powd/PM2Ex.png")
```

Metal powders are elemental or alloyed metals mixed with binders,
lubricants, deflocullates, and additives before pressing. A binding
mixture consolidates the loose powder. Lubricants are necessary because
clearances values between punches and dies used for powder pressing
typically are less than .001 inch. Deflocullates stop the metal powder
from clumping. Introducing additives can improve powder composition
machinability, wear resistance, or lubricity. Force for pressing for
most parts typically varies between 10,000 lbs/in2 (70 MPa) and 120,000
lbs/in2 (800 MPa). Parts for this type of manufacture are mostly small
(under 5 lbs), and press requirements are typically under 100 tons.
Presses with capacities of several thousand tons are sometimes used for
work requiring more force. Double action presses, with opposing top and
bottom punches, are common to reach the level and distribution of powder
desired for compaction. The pressure the press can deliver dictates the
upper limit of the size of a part. Increasing the speed of pressing
enhances productivity, but pressing too fast can trap air that can
prevent the part from compacting properly.

In 2019, press-and-sinter processes produced approximately 93.0% of the
volume of worldwide PM$^{2}$ industry output [@grandviewresearch2020].
However, various PM$^{2}$ processes are available, some of which can add
high market value but have correspondingly high production costs: 

- In
*metal injection molding*, metal powder is conventionally injection
molded to produce a green compact for sintering. \
- *Isostatic pressing*
confines metal powder inside a flexible membrane surrounding a mold
which acts as a barrier between the metal powder and a liquid or gas
pressurizing medium. Isostatic pressing is adapted especially to
relatively large, complex-shaped parts. \
- *Powder forging* compacts metal
powders into a "preform" shape in a die. The preformed shape is
sintered. The sintered preform is coated with a lubricant and is closed
die forged [@cfsforge2022]. Forging causes plastic flow, resulting in a
dense, non--porous, dimensionally--precise, low waste part that
possesses desirable mechanical properties. \
- *Spray forming* is used to
produce semi-finished mill products in the form of billets, tubes, and
sheets through high--rate deposition of atomized powder metal
layer-by-layer onto a substrate to form, after their solidification, a
bulk product or thick coating. \
- An innovative PM$^{2}$ process generating
considerable attention is *additive manufacturing*, a group of
fabrication processes through which three-dimensional parts are
constructed by adding layers of materials on point, line, or planar
surfaces [@hassanin2015]---i.e., 3D printing using fine grade metal
powders. Metal injection molders are researching potential manufacturing
marriages with additive manufacturing processes
[@metalpowderindustriesfederation2019a].

### Sintering

Sintering creates metallurgical bonds between the powder particles,
adding desirable mechanical and physical properties to the part.
Sintering occurs in a sintering furnace in a controlled atmosphere that
can enhance PM$^{2}$ part properties by, for instance, regulating
oxidation, reduction, and carbon content, making heating and cooling
uniform, producing a uniform microstructure of the product, and adding
corrosion resistance. Since the late 1970s, a nitrogen/hydrogen mix has
become the atmosphere of choice for PM$^{2}$ sintering [@dwyer2022;
@minghecasting2021].

The typical sintering furnace contains a continuous mesh belt moving
through three operating zones: (a) a pre-heat zone that burns off
binders and lubricants added at the pressing phase and increases the
temperature of the green part; (b) a hot zone in which the part raised
to 70% to 90% of its melting point; and (c) a cooling zone, in which the
part's temperature is gradually lowered. Post--sintering processes also
can occur, such as machining, repressing (for decreased porosity and
increased hardness), impregnating with oil or resin (to produce a
self--lubricating part), infiltrating with another metal (to remove
residual porosity and enhance part strength), plating, coating,
deburring, welding, steam treating (to oxidize surfaces for strength and
density improvement), or furnace brazing with other parts. However, an
efficiency feature of PM$^{2}$ is that most finished parts require
little or no secondary machining operations, such as stamped or forged
parts.

A practical and distinguishing metallurgical feature of PM$^{2}$
processes is that parts for sintering are not subject to Gibbs' phase
rule ([@verret2020, p. 227] that would apply if these metals were
alloyed by melting. This feature means that PM$^{2}$ does not face many
of the same chemical, thermal, and containment restraints placed on
materials alloyed by melting due to intersections and disjunctions of
their various liquid and solid phases [@powderm2022].

## Markets

### For Resources

PM$^{2}$ purchases many of the inputs to processes from suppliers, just
as most complex manufacturing operations do. However, PM$^{2}$ producers
purchase two critical supplies [@pickpm2022e]. One set of inputs
includes metal powders, lubricants, binders, additives, and other raw
materials that go into making finished parts. Another set consists of
the tooling, process equipment, industrial gases, and related services.
Also, some PM$^{2}$ producers might choose to outsource post-sintering
product finishing.

Metal powder is a unique and essential input to PM$^{2}$ processes. In
north-central Pennsylvania, ferrous metal powder is dominant in
production. Ferrous powder accounted for 89% of the global volume share
of metal powder purchased in 2019 [@grandviewresearch2020a]. Atomization
is the most popular method of metal powder production
[@libraryofmanufacturing2022a]. In the gas atomization technique, the
most common atomization method [@uygun2021], molten metal is provided
through a nozzle, where it is atomized by an inert gas jet. This inert
gas jet separates the molten metal into small metal dimples. These
dimples solidify to produce metal powder. The powder can vary by shape,
porosity, flow and friction characteristics, surface chemistry, and bulk
density and is mixed before packing to include lubricants, binders,
deflocculates additives, and additional materials
[@libraryofmanufacturing2022a].

Tooling is another critical and unique input to PM$^{2}$ processes. A
close fit of a punch with a die is necessary so that pressed metal
particles do not become stuck in the clearance between the punch and
die. Most punches and dies are made from hardened tool steels, the
surfaces of which are ground and polished or lapped in the direction of
tool movement. Tungsten carbide is used to make punches and dies for
more powerful powder pressing operations. These features demand high
tolerance production of machine tooling and dictate careful tool use,
maintenance, and care requirements.

Many PM$^{2}$ suppliers---gas furnace fabricators, gas suppliers,
machine shops---are proximal to PM$^{2}$ producers in the north-central
Pennsylvania region. Metal powder is supplied from outside the region.

### For Products

The global PM$^{2}$ market was valued at \$7.49 Billion (US) in 2020 and
is projected to reach \$12.63 Billion by 2028, growing at a compound
annual growth rate of 6.77% from 2021 to 2028
[@verifiedmarketresearch2021]. The increasing demand for PM$^{2}$ parts
in manufacturing automotive components is a significant factor in this
global growth [@grandviewresearch2020b; @researchandmarkets2020;
@zanon2017], especially in China and India [@menafin2022]. The
automotive industry is the customer for most of the PM$^{2}$ parts
produced in north-central Pennsylvania.

According to the Metal Powder Industries Federation
[-@metalpowderindustriesfederation2022], the typical U.S. light-duty
vehicle contains about 37 pounds of PM$^{2}$ parts. Pickup trucks
average about 60-95, depending on the configuration. The standard U.S.
passenger sedan averages 20 pounds. More than an estimated 1.5 billion
PM$^{2}$ powder forged connecting rods have been made for light-duty
vehicles produced in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Commercial aircraft
engines contain 1,500-4,400 pounds of PM$^{2}$ per engine.

The automotive industry and its consumers are moving quickly away from
the internal combustion engine in favor of fully electric vehicles and
hybrids, however. Increased sticker prices have made new vehicles less
affordable for some consumers. The average income of a new vehicle buyer
was \$124,000 in 2021 [@deka2021]. And, with global supply disruptions
and rising inflation, the number of vehicles sold in the United States
in early 2022 plummeted [@rosevear2022]. Consequently, the demand for
PM$^{2}$ connecting rods, main bearing caps, and other internal
combustion engine components is likely to decline.

The PM$^{2}$ industry hopes to leverage its extensive experience in
supplying the automotive industry experience to supply electric vehicle
producers. For instance, GKN Power Metallurgy is responding to the
increasing demand for a stable supply of permanent magnets, which are
vital components of electric vehicle motors [@klaus2022]. Fiodin &
Kianan [-@fiodin2021], based on a teardown of a Tesla vehicle, found
that the use of PM$^{2}$ parts in transmissions of electric vehicles
could lower manufacturing costs by approximately 20% (p. 50). Other
markets are emerging. For instance, aerospace and defense demand for
PM$^{2}$ parts is increasing in the PM$^{2}$ market
[@stratviewresearch2022], but not a large factor in north-central
Pennsylvania PM$^{2}$ output.

## Concentration in North-Central Pennsylvania

Employment and wages in PM$^{2}$ in the United States are highly
concentrated in just three rural counties in north-central Pennsylvania:
Jefferson, Elk, and Cameron (See Figure \@ref(fig:img-geo)). The
Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
classifies these three counties as rural due to relatively low
population density and distance from metropolitan areas [@usdaers2013].
Our analysis of Economic Research Service data sets [@usdaers2022]
revealed that two counties (Jefferson and Cameron) experience moderately
high household poverty levels. Less than 20% of the population of these
two counties have completed high school. All three counties have
experienced long-term population declines. These socioeconomic
conditions accent the importance of PM$^{2}$ dominance for the economic
well-being of residents in the three-county region.

```{r img-geo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2, out.width="75%", fig.cap='*Jefferson, Elk, and Cameron Counties in Pennsylvania contained 38% of establishments, employed 38% of workers, and paid 36% of wages in PM$^{2}$ (NAICS 332177) in the United States, 2021 4th Quarter* <br> ( Map created using MapChart [-@mapchart2022]. Calculations of shares of establishments, employment, and wages using data from Bureau of Labor Statistics [@bureauoflaborstatistics2022]. NAICS 332177 is a six-digit classification used for classifying PM$^{2}$ industry activity by the U.S. Census Bureau [-@bureauofthecensus2022].'}

```

Documented in Table 1 is the high concentration of employment and wages
in PM$^{2}$ in north-central Pennsylvania. The PM$^{2}$ industry makes
up a much larger share of Pennsylvania's employment total than it does
for the nation.^[A PM$^{2}$ industry analyst told me that the Bureau of Labor Statistics undercounts establishments and employment in the PM$^{2}$ industry due to inconsistencies and flaws in the way that NAICS codes are assigned to establishments.] The concentration of PM$^{2}$ employment and wages in
Pennsylvania is more than 13 times the concentration of employment and
wages for PM$^{2}$ in the U.S. workforce. Pennsylvania is the location
for 38% of all U.S. establishments producing PM$^{2}$ parts.^[Refer to
Bureau of Labor Statistics [-@bureauoflaborstatistics2021a] and Wheeler
[-@WHEELER2005115a] for additional detail about calculation and
interpretation of location quotients.]

  )
```

Even more remarkable are the extraordinarily high concentrations of
PM$^{2}$ employment and wages in the three counties---i.e.,
concentrations of employment and wages between 758 and 7833 times higher
than in the nation. These very dense employment and wage concentrations
indicate the dominance of PM$^{2}$ in north-central Pennsylvania in the
national PM$^{2}$ industry. Jefferson, Elk, and Cameron counties in
Pennsylvania contained 38% of establishments, employed 38% of workers,
and paid 36% of wages in PM$^{2}$ in the U.S. during 2021.

High industry employment and wage concentrations in PM$^{2}$ within the
region, relative to the nation, highlight the importance of the industry
for exports from the north-central region. Shields [-@shields2003]
stated, "An exporting industry is one where the industry not only meets
the demand for its products, but also produces enough so it can sell
outside the region....A location quotient greater than 1.0 indicates
that the economy is self--sufficient, and may even be exporting the good
or the service of that particular industry" (p. 3). Industries such as
PM$^{2}$ sell exports outside a region to contribute to the region's
economic base. Economic base theory (explicated in Munroe & Biles
[-@munroe2005]) suggests that the means for strengthening and growing
the local economy is to develop and enhance the exporting sectors
[@klosterman1990, p. 115]. In this way, PM$^{2}$ is a driving "engine"
for the north-central Pennsylvania economy.

## Competitive Forces

We analyzed competitive forces affecting the PM$^{2}$ in north-central
Pennsylvania using techniques specified by Porter [-@porter1998]; see
also @porters2022). The analysis drew on information from structured
face--to--face and telephone meetings, gleaned during plant tours and
over informal lunches, and captured in confidences revealed in
unstructured personal conversations. Competitive forces identified were
summarized around five themes: the threat of entry of new competitors;
bargaining power of customers; bargaining power of suppliers; the threat
posed by substitute products; and the nature of competitive rivalry
within the PM part manufacturing industry. We conclude that the
environment for PM$^{2}$ in north-central Pennsylvania is highly
competitive.

*The threat of entry of new competitors.* The potential of profitable
markets can draw firms to the region's PM$^{2}$ industry either through
acquisitions and mergers or through start-ups. New entrants can affect
the competitive climate in many ways. For example, new entrants can
bring additional capacity to the PM$^{2}$ industry in the region,
capture market share from incumbents, bid down industry prices, or
inflate incumbent's costs, and, in these ways, effectively affect the
profitability of incumbents.

*Bargaining power of customers*. Customers for PM$^{2}$ parts from
north-central Pennsylvania are primarily from the highly concentrated
automotive industry. These PM$^{2}$ customers enjoy strong bargaining
power for PM$^{2}$ part prices. In some cases, customers drive the
industry's prices down, bargain for more or better service at the same
or lower prices, and pit firms in the industry against one another.
PM$^{2}$ firms in north-central Pennsylvania produce standard,
undifferentiated PM$^{2}$ parts, so buyers face low costs of switching
among PM$^{2}$ producers.

*Bargaining power of suppliers.* A small number of suppliers affects the
PM$^{2}$ industry in north-central Pennsylvania. For example, suppliers
can raise prices in response to changes in their own markets or reduce
the quality of their products without lowering prices. At the extreme,
some suppliers refuse to work with a firm or charge excessively high
prices for unique resources. Because few suppliers are available, few
supply substitutes exist, and costs to the PM$^{2}$ firms for switching
suppliers are high, suppliers hold strong bargaining power.

*The threat of substitute products.* Substitutes for PM$^{2}$ parts
increase the propensity of customers to switch to alternative products
in response to price increases. High elasticity of substitution for some
PM$^{2}$ parts by product alternatives limits the potential returns in
the PM$^{2}$ industry by capping price changes. Attractive price/quality
substitutes for PM$^{2}$ parts place a tight lid on PM$^{2}$ firm
profits in north-central Pennsylvania. Competitive rivalry within the
industry. North-central Pennsylvania contains a close community of
PM$^{2}$ firms. Rivalry among firms is a significant determinant of the
PM$^{2}$ competitive climate in the region. Rivalry for advantage in
product and resource markets often occurs along price dimensions.
Regional rivals also compete aggressively on non--price dimensions such
as innovation, marketing, branding, public recognition, and family
rivalries.

## Concluding Remarks

The PM$^{2}$ industry is a small niche within the metal stamping and
forging industry in the United States. PM$^{2}$ firms in north-central
Pennsylvania hold a large portion of that small niche. Although PM$^{2}$
in the region depends on the automotive industry for demand for
press-and-sinter parts for internal combustion engines, opportunities
are emerging for producing PM$^{2}$ parts for electric vehicles. The
PM$^{2}$ industry cluster in north-central Pennsylvania is an example of
a successful regional agglomeration of manufacturing leading to regional
economic advantage and technological leadership.
