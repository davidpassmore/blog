## Trade Tech for Pay?

### A Survey by Lucas Systems, Inc.

@lucassystemsinc.b, a Wexford, Pennsylvania, developer of technology
solutions for distribution centers, commissioned a study of 500 on-floor
warehouse workers across multiple geographies and job roles in the U.S.
An eight-page brochure, *Voice of the Warehouse Worker Insights*
[@lucassystemsinc.2022f], reported findings of the study designed to
identify "how workers feel about stress, the need for technology, and
working with robots" [@lucassystemsinc.2022e, para. 3 ).

### Survey Findings

A statement [@berardi] distributed on June 29, 2022 announcing the
brochure's release indicated that

> "Nearly 3 out of 4...on-floor workers said they would consider a pay
> cut at another company for an opportunity to use technology if it
> helps them in their job. Workers also said they are physically spent,
> spending over a third of their day walking and would welcome tech's
> help in the form of robots or other tech tools."

A concentration of younger workers -- 81% of Generation Z[^1] workers
responding to the survey -- was at least somewhat likely "to trade tech
for pay" [@lucassystemsinc.2022f, p.2]. Note that this is not a
sentiment to accept a pay cut in a current job, but to consider lower
than current pay in an entirely new job.

[^1]: Researchers and popular media use the mid- to late-1990s as
    starting birth years and the 2010s as ending birth years of
    Generation Z [@generati2022]. I don't know about you, but I believe
    that stereotyping demographic groups simply by a range of birth
    years is limiting, at best, and could lead, at worst, to overt or
    covert discrimination. .

This finding is not unique. For instance, @mas2017 found that the
average national call center worker was willing to give up 20% of wages
to avoid a schedule set by an employer on short notice and 8% of wages
for the option to work from home.

### Other Findings

Other conclusions extracted from the brochure released by Lucas Systems
include [@berardi2022, Â¶5]:

-   Workers want to stay with their employer but feel improvements are
    necessary to make their jobs easier. Workers generally anticipate
    staying at their current employer for at least three years (74%)
    with 35% anticipating a tenure longer than five years.\
-   75% of workers say physical strain in their jobs takes a larger toll
    on them than the mental strain. The leading cause of physical strain
    is carrying and/or lifting followed by walking and/or traveling.
-   Top causes of mental strain include meeting performance or incentive
    goals and objectives (25%) and safely maneuvering around the
    warehouse (20%).
-   Workers see robots as productive allies but fear increased quotas.
    More than 2 in 5 believe robots will reduce physical stress (46%) or
    help them achieve better speed in item picking (44%) or better
    accuracy (40%).

@lucassystemsinc.2022f declared that: technology tools are essential to
the well-being and retention of workers; training is vital to the
adoption of technology tools; and gradual introduction of workers to
technology tools is necessary (p. 8).

### Perhaps a Broader Meaning Exists

Certainly is interesting information is presented in the brochure
distributed by Lucas Systems, information that points to the value
proposition for products that Lucas Systems manufactures.[^2] I wish I
could examine documentation about the collection, organization, and
analysis of the survey data. Even so, the information from the Lucas
Systems' survey stimulates assessment of the floating meanings of work
and pay as our economy suffers through a lingering pandemic, is besieged
by political division and unrest, and is buffeted by war and rumors of
war, all factors that have collided to hobble worldwide supply chains
for human and capital resources.

[^2]: Lucas Systems reports on its website that "With the help of Lucas,
    [*I deleted firm name*] has seen a 40% increase in throughput while
    reducing labor by 20%" [@lucassystemsinc.c].

## The Work and Pay Plexus

### A Very Narrow View

Taking a narrow, pecuniary view, pay originates from a transaction, an
exchange of time and effort by workers for money from the owners of
capital. The owners of physical capital buy human capital for
production. A commodity exchange. The workers are as interchangeable as
the paper currency they receive. Neat. Separate. Symmetrical. But,
largely a theoretical characterization.

Buyers and sellers meet at a price. Labor supply, then, is the amount
and kind of labor that is available at a given wage. Need more labor?
Increase the wage. What is the optimal wage? Just enough to supply the
human capital for production. All following the textbook, right? Almost
as lawful as, say, Archimedes' Buoyancy Principle. Now, before you yell
"Eureka!" and run naked through the streets of Syracuse as Archimedes
did when he noticed that he displaced water when he sat in the tub,
consider that the concept of pay is more knotty and involuted than you
first might have thought.

### Well, Maybe a Little More Than That?

Let's crack the stern exterior of the wage-labor theory of exchange with
a dose of economic reality. Some economists have acknowledged that even
the sequence of "worth-as-pay-as-money" can incorporate non-pecuniary
elements. In *Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith wrote in 1776:

> "The wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness
> or dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness of the
> employment. Thus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman
> tailor earns less than a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A
> journeyman weaver earns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not
> always easier, but it is much cleanlier. A journeyman blacksmith,
> though an artificer, seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a

> The trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business; but it is
> in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades.
> The most detestable of all employments, that of public executioner,
> is, in proportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any
> common trade whatever." (@smith1776, Book 1, Chapter 10, para. 5)

In practice, economists identify this type of variation in pay as a
*compensating differential* [@smith1979a, p. 339]. These differentials
are higher wages that are paid to workers who perform jobs that have
particular hazards or other unpleasant features associated with them.
Some examples are: premium pay for working second- or third-shift work
schedules; hazard pay for combat, police protection, or fire service;
higher pay for underground coal miners exposed to the risk of injury and
lung disease; or pay differences by geographic region that reflect costs
of living differences or remoteness of location. The role of a
compensating differential is to maintain a supply of labor in
challenging conditions that might otherwise depress interest in acquiring
or staying in a job.

Workers have their own ways of differentiating compensation. Workers can
react negatively when faced with pay cuts in their own jobs, especially
when the reasons for the cuts are not judged by workers as reasonable
[@chen2016]. For example, @coviello2022 described a pay cut at a call
center that was motivated by cost-cutting, not by lower productivity of
call center employees. Some workers quit. Others, though, engaged in
counterproductive behavior that hurt the firm as well as the pay of
commission-driven employees. Some workers, especially those among with
the highest expressed loyalty and longest work tenure, intentionally
sold the wrong items, as opposed to simply optimally shirking on effort
in response to the pay cut.

@greenberg2001 observed what he described as "reciprocal deviance," that
is, employees' perceptions that their employers' defaults on their
obligations encouraged employees to respond with similar acts of
deviance. In particular, theft (termed, in a Orwellian sense,
"shrinkage" in retail industries) rose during a period in which pay was
temporarily reduced by 15%. In some cases, pay cuts to current workers
can be more disruptive that downsizing the numbers of employees
[@yoon2017a]. Pay not only produces buying power but also becomes a
measure of self-worth and respect from others.

Consistent with the findings from the survey by Lucas Systems, research
on variation in wages and salaries reveals that workers and employers
see more meaning in pay than just plan money.

### Is That All There Is?

From a macro perspective, the meaning of work is a shared cultural
concept associated with values, beliefs, and norms. Among individual
workers, though, the meaning of work is variegated, contextual, and
idiosyncratic. According to @rothausen2019,

> Jobs can fulfill (or not fulfill) basic human needs (some would say
> rights) for dignity in work, meaningful work, and some level of
> economic justice. Jobs also affect workers' lives, and thus their
> worlds, fundamentally....Therefore, key meanings of work spring from
> basic human needs from work, and from workers' larger worlds, and
> these elements likely impact workers' satisfaction related to their
> jobs. (p. 359)

Pay is not the only return to investment of time and efforts in work.
Seen broadly, work permits the expression of talents, empowers the
development of self, offers friendship and social relations, and affords
a transcendent role in a collective contribution to an endeavor larger
than self (see [@rothausen2019, Table 2]). This many-sided, complex
perspective is a key attribute running through manifold theoretical
perspectives and empirical research streams focusing on the meaning of
work that human beings seek. "Overall job satisfaction is the sum of the
evaluations of the discriminable elements of which the job is composed"
[@locke1969, p. 330]. Pay alone is not the sole factor that draws and
retains a worker to a job.

*So, perhaps the respondents to the Lucas Systems' survey who said they
would consider a pay cut are weighing bundles of non-pecuniary
attributes of potential jobs as important enough to compensate for lower
pay.*

## Huh? A Pay Cut?

### Yep. A Cut Might Fulfill Broader Needs

Although accepting or seeking a pay cut might seem like an error in
judgment, workers might view the trade-off of pay for other
non-pecuniary returns to work as a way to maintain or increase the
subjective utility of work to satisfy their many diverse wants. In this
way, seeking or accepting a pay cut might be viewed as a rational
decision to achieve a satisfaction balance in life.

As @blanchflower2017 found, having a job is an essential determinant of
satisfaction with life, no matter what income level a person has
attained. In what is almost a transcendent conception of work,
@coleman2021, career coaches, consider a paycheck as a "clear path to
doing work you love" (the subtitle of their book). Our personal
experience can attest to the belief that money is but one form of
compensation. Of course, the role of money in our lives cannot be
dismissed entirely. @clark2018 concluded that an almost universally
accepted research outcome in studies of the economics of happiness is
that "individuals who are observed to have higher levels of income in
cross-section data also report higher levels of subjective well-being"
(Section 2.1).

### Profits Are at an All-Time High -- Why Not Share?

Many observers wonder why pay cuts are even necessary while corporate
profits are at a 70-year high (profits over time are displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-prof)). The @federalreservebankofrichmond2021 found that
80% of firms increased prices to cover the higher costs of inputs during
recent pandemic and inflationary periods. Also, the economic chaos
during these periods offered opportunities to raise profit margins
beyond the increase in costs, especially among larger firms. For
instance, a 2022 survey of 1,000 retailers revealed that over one-half
of respondents raised prices beyond rising costs and offered fewer or no
discounts during the holiday season [@moretha2022].

```{r img-prof, layout="l-screen", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*U.S. Quarterly Corporate Business Profits After Taxes, 1952-2022.* <br> (billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted; graphic created from  @federalreservebankofst.louis.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/payc/fredgraph.png")
```

Reasons given from the employers' side for not sharing this high rate of
profitability with workers include:

-   Profits are distributed to shareholders, the owners of firms.

-   Sharing profits with workers transforms profit into an expense.

-   Profits, although perhaps high at the moment, are just returns to
    long-term investment.

In short, it's ours, not yours.

Fitting with these reasons, workers' share of income from production
has declined steadily. A 2019 McKinsey Global Institute report
[@manyika2019a.] documented the decline in labor's share of income in
the United States. Although labor's share already had started to
decrease in the 1960s, McKinsey estimated that three-fourths of the
entire post-1947 decline occurred between 2000 and 2016 (see trends in
Figure \@ref(fig:img-labsh)). The steepest part of the decline -- from
63.3% in 2000 to 56.7% in 2016 -- followed a moderate downward drift in
the 1980s and early 1990s, and a slight recovery in the late 1990s.

```{r img-labsh, layout="l-body-outset", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*McKinsey Global Institute Estimate of Declining Labor Share of Income in the United States* <br> (Graphic from @manyika2019a.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/payc/SVGZ-New-look-declining-labor-share-Ex1.png")
```

@manyika2019b even more narrowly attributed this decline to specific
industrial activity:

> Twelve sectors that make up about one-third of employment and 44
> percent of economic output explain the overall decline in labor share
> or increase in capital share. These sectors represent a broad and
> diverse set of economic activities. They are: mining and quarrying;
> construction; real estate; coke and refined petroleum; motor vehicles;
> pharmaceuticals and chemicals; computer, electronics, and optical
> products; publishing, audiovisual, and telecom; computer programming
> and consulting; information services; wholesale and retail, and
> *transportation and storage*. [emphasis mine] (Part 2)

Improvements in technology in these 12 sectors led to the substitution
of capital for labor and the creation of intangible and intellectual
products that have faster depreciation cycles than for tangible
equipment. These factors helped transportation and storage firms, a
subsection of which Lucas Systems serves, join in the 12 sectors that
accounted for the largest declines in the labor share of income. The
findings of the survey by Lucas Systems indicate that workers also might
see some advantages to the capital-labor substitution that can help
rationalize their sentiments about trading pay cuts for increasing
technology at work.

## But, Wait, Isn't It the Economy, Stupid?

"*It's the economy, stupid*" was a widely-quoted catchphrase authored by
James Carville, a strategist in Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign
for U.S. President, to remind campaign workers to stay on message.
Thinking along these lines, perhaps it is a mistake to over-analyze the willingness of workers to
accept lower pay with anything other than ordinary concepts of suppl;y
and demand. Maybe it is just that....the economy?

The U.S. economy has faced what some people have called *The Great
Resignation*, but perhaps a better characterization is *The Great
Reshuffle*. Job openings and job quitting have been at all-time highs
for months, while layoffs fell to a record low. Employers raised wages
to attract workers. All while the threats to traditional work
arrangements from the pandemic were pervasive. Yet, about one-half of
job quitters did not drop out of the workforce. They quit to move to new
jobs.

Willis Towers Watson polled 9,658 U.S. employees from large and midsize
private employers across a broad range of industries in December 2021
and January 2022 [@willistowerswatson2021]. Over half of workers (56%)
said pay is a top reason they would look for a job with a different
employer. Forty-one percent would leave for a 5% increase. But almost
20% said they'd take a new job for the same pay --- suggesting factors
other than wages are important, too -- as respondents to the survey from
Lucas Systems indicated. Health benefits, job security, flexible work
arrangements and retirement benefits were behind pay, respectively, as
the top five reasons employees would move elsewhere. Many survey
respondents expressed preferences remote work just as employers were
encouraging workers to return on-site to the office.

As a result, the economy has featured an almost unprecedented sellers'
market for labor. @elting2021a summarized the critical elements of the
current unique market for labor:

> Employers must compete for workers because there are far more open
> slots than job applicants, and workers are smart enough to recognize
> that. Yes, they're voting with their feet in favor of more flexible
> work hours, continued availability of remote work, higher wages, and
> better treatment, but the context that makes that possible, the basic
> calculus of supply and demand in the labor market, goes ignored. There
> are a lot of jobs and people are re-entering the labor market with
> reluctance and recalculating their options.

So, it *is* the economy, after all. The demand for labor post-pandemic
was driven by the release of pent-up consumer demand. The need for
workers to return to work ran head-on into reluctance to return due to
such matters as the unavailability of child care. Time away from work
and COVID stimulus checks to households during the pandemic offered time
and income buffers for workers to ponder whether retirement was best or
whether they wanted to seek or train for new work that might raise their
subjective well--being.

In a way, the pandemic and the disruption around it ironically created
an opportunities for workers. One door closes, another opens, allowing a
kind of creative destruction that becomes possible during periods of
change and chaos.

[An-Li Herring](https://www.wesa.fm/people/an-li-herring), reporter for
90.5 WESA-FM Pittsburgh NPR, conducted an interview with me about the
brochure summarizing the findings from the survey that was distributed
by Lucas Systems and, then, incorporated the interview into her article,
"Survey: As online ordering grows, warehouse workers say they need more
tech to save their bodies" [@herring2022]. I gathered the notes I
prepared for her interview with me to write this blog posting after Ms.
Herring's posting was published.
