### Trade Tech for Pay?

@lucassystemsinc.a, a Wexford, Pennsylvania, developer of technology
solutions for distribution centers, commissioned a study of 500 on-floor
warehouse workers across the U.S. An eight-page brochure, *Voice of the
Warehouse Worker Insights* [@lucassystemsinc.2022], reported findings of
the study which was meant to uncover "how workers feel about stress, the
need for technology, and working with robots (para. 1). A release of the
brochure distributed on June 29, 2022 [@berardi] indicated that

> "Nearly 3 out of 4...on-floor workers said they would consider a pay
> cut at another company for an opportunity to use technology if it
> helps them in their job. Workers also said they are physically spent,
> spending over a third of their day walking and would welcome tech's
> help in the form of robots or other tech tools."

Younger workers, 81% of Generation Z[^1] Lucas survey respondents, were
at least somewhat likely "to trade tech for pay"
[@lucassystemsinc.2022a, p. 2].

[^1]: Researchers and popular media use the mid to late 1990s as
    starting birth years and the 2010s as ending birth years
    [@generati2022].

Other conclusions released from the brochure include [@berardi2022, Â¶5]:

-   Workers want to stay with their employer but feel improvements are
    necessary to make their jobs easier. Workers generally anticipate
    staying at their current employer for at least three years (74%)
    with 35% anticipating a tenure longer than five years.\
-   75% of workers say physical strain in their jobs takes a larger toll
    on them than the mental strain. The leading cause of physical strain
    is carrying and/or lifting followed by walking and/or traveling.
-   Top causes of mental strain include meeting performance or incentive
    goals and objectives (25%) and safely maneuvering around the
    warehouse (20%).
-   Workers see robots as productive allies but fear increased quotas.
    More than 2 in 5 believe robots will reduce physical stress (46%) or
    help them achieve better speed in item picking (44%) or better
    accuracy (40%).

@lucassystemsinc.2022c declared that: technology tools are essential to
the well-being and retention of workers; training is vital to the
adoption of technology tools; and gradual introduction of workers to
technology tools is necessary (p. 8).

Interesting information in the brochure distributed by Lucas Systems. I
wish I could examine the report documenting the research behind the
brochure. I have many questions about collecting, organizing, and
analyzing the data. Even so, the information from the Lucas Systems'
survey stimulates my thinking about the floating meanings of work and
pay as our economy experiences a pandemic, suffers political turmoil,
and is besieged by war and rumors of war, all colliding to stress the
supply chains for human and capital resources.

### Changing Share of Labor Income

The labor share of income in 35 advanced economies fell from around 54
percent in 1980 to 50.5 percent in 2014. In some advanced economies
including France and Germany, labor income shares reached the lowest
level of the past half century just before the global financial crisis
of 2008, although the patterns in individual countries varied.

Developing economies have also experienced the same phenomenon, albeit
to a lesser extent. Available studies suggest that the labor share of
income fell from 39 percent in 1993 to 37.4 percent in 2014, a drop of
about 4 percent.

The decline in labor share of income in the United States since the turn
of the millennium has been particularly marked and is the focus of our
analysis. Official data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
suggest that, while the labor share had already started to decrease in
the 1960s, three-fourths of the entire post-1947 decline occurred
between 2000 and 2016 (Exhibit 1). The steepest part of the
decline---from 63.3 percent in 2000 to 56.7 percent in 2016---followed a
moderate downward drift in the 1980s and early 1990s, and a slight
recovery in the late 1990s.

### The Work and Pay Plexus

#### A Narrow View

A narrow position is that work and pay result from a transaction, an
exchange of time and effort by workers to produce for money from the
owners of capital. The owners of physical capital buy human capital for
production. Neat. Separate. Symmetrical. And, theoretical.

Buyers and sellers meet at a price. Labor supply, then, is the amount or
kind of labor that is available at a given wage. Need more labor?
Increase the wage. What is the optimal wage? Just enough to supply the
human capital for production. All following the textbook, right?

#### Is That All There Is?

The meaning of work in our lives is a created as a shared cultural
concept. At the same time, the meaning of work in the lives of workers
is defined in variegated, contextual, and idiosyncratic ways. According
to @rothausen2019,

> Jobs can fulfill (or not fulfill) basic human needs (some would say
> rights) for dignity in work, meaningful work, and some level of
> economic justice. Jobs also affect workers' lives, and thus their
> worlds, fundamentally....Therefore, key meanings of work spring from
> basic human needs from work, and from workers' larger worlds, and
> these elements likely impact workers' satisfaction related to their
> jobs. (p. 359)

This complexity is a key feature in assorted theoretical perspectives
about work and empirical research streams focusing on the meaning of
work for human beings. "Overall job satisfaction is the sum of the
evaluations of the discriminable elements of which the job is composed"
[@locke1969, p. 330]. Pay alone is not the sole factor that draws and
retains a worker to a job.

@manyika2019 on labor share

percent in 1980 to 50.5 percent in 2014. In some advanced economies
including France and Germany, labor income shares reached the lowest
level of the past half century just before the global financial crisis

@coviello2022, @greenberg2018, on effects of pay cuts

Workers forced to accept pay cuts are prone to counterproductive
behavior like theft, low morake, even more than downsizing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@rothausen2019a, table 2 -- Pay is important but not everything in a
job.

Allows expression of self, core values, talents, gifts Allows
development of self, grow,learn, change, expand Provides a role in a
transcendant purpose, worthwhile endeavor, collective contribution,
something larger than self Affords life construction through leisure,
friendships, health, religion, citizenship,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

compensating differentials -- shift premiums, hazard pay, geographic
differentials

Compensating wage differentials are higher wages (than can seemingly be
explained by reference to skill level or human capital) that are paid to
workers who perform jobs that have particular hazards or other
unpleasant features associated with them. The phenomenon has long been
identified by economists and indeed was noted by Adam Smith in The
Wealth of Nations: '...the wages of labour vary with the ease or
hardship, the cleanliness or dirtiness, the honourableness or
dishonourableness, of the employment.... A journeyman blacksmith, though
an artificer, seldom earns so much in twelve hours, as a collier, who is
only a labourer, does in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less
dangerous, and is carried on in day-light, and above ground.' The higher
wages paid to workers in hazardous jobs, where there is a risk of
accident and injury, has been a particular focus of economic research
but there are many types of compensating differential. Payment of a
London allowance can be understood in these terms as can higher payments
for those in insecure or fixed-term jobs or those who work unsocial
hours. Relatively high wages paid to those performing sex work, might
provide another example.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[@elting2021] -- employees have options in great resignation

employers must compete for workers because there are far more open slots
than job applicants, and workers are smart enough to recognize that.
Yes, they're voting with their feet in favor of more flexible work
hours, continued availability of remote work, higher wages, and better
treatment, but the context that makes that possible, the basic calculus
of supply and demand in the labor market, goes ignored. There are a lot
of jobs and people are re-entering the labor market with reluctance and
recalculating their options.
