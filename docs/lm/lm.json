When this essay was\npublished, the term “green jobs,” was prominent in policy and public\ndiscussions. Interestingly, as I post this item, the Russia;s war on\nUkraine has made alternate energy futures a hot topic again.\n\nHey, remember green jobs? Looks like Pennsylvania has some.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor, green jobs are slightly more concentrated in\nPennsylvania than in the entire U.S., not only among all private sector\njobs, but also within some industries.\nBut, you might ask, as many people have continued to do, what are\ngreen jobs? Certainly, a good working definition of green jobs could\nlead to good measurements of green job counts and opportunities, which\nare critical to national and regional economic policy development,\neconomic research and planning, and education and training\ninvestment.\nThe definition of green jobs, however, rarely has been clear.\nFor example, in his book, “The Green Collar Economy,” Van Jones —\none-time Obama “Special Policy Advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and\nInnovation” — defined green jobs as “good local jobs that pay well,\nstrengthen communities, provide pathways out of poverty, and help solve\nenvironmental problems.” Phil Angelides, chair of Apollo Alliance, a\ncoalition of industry, labor, and environmental groups, once said that\ngreen jobs are characterized by “decent wages and benefits that can\nsupport a family. It has to be part of a real career path, with upward\nmobility.”\nIn response, we fist pump, “Rah! Rah!,” of course. Yet, most\ndefinitions of green jobs offered when the green economy was the policy\nleitmotif–of–the–month are not specific enough to guide labor market\nstrategies, policies, and tactics.\nThe BLS tackled head–on the thorny and controversial problem of\ndefining green jobs which has vexed and confused policy discussions\nabout transforming our vast and varied economy to be more\nenvironmentally conscious and energy conserving.\nThe BLS used two approaches to defining green jobs and, then, to\nmeasuring green jobs through a mail survey of U.S. establishments. The\ncommon thread in these two approaches is that green jobs preserve or\nrestore the environment.\nFirst, some green jobs make green goods and services.\nThe BLS counted jobs as “green” at establishments producing goods and\nservices that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.\nWorkers in these jobs produce energy from renewable sources, make\nproducts that improve energy efficiency, abate pollution, reduce\ngreenhouse gasses, recycle or reuse products, conserve natural\nresources, or encourage compliance with environmental regulations and\ngood practices through education, training, and public awareness.\nSecond, the BLS counted jobs through which workers make their own\nestablishments’ work processes more environmentally friendly or use\nfewer natural resources. Workers in these green jobs use energy from\nrenewable sources which is generated through efficient technologies and\npractices. And, these workers employ processes that abate pollution or\nthat conserve natural resources.\nDisplayed in the chart accompanying our article (“Percent of U.S.\n& PA….”) are percentages of green jobs within private sector\nindustries in the U.S. and in Pennsylvania during 2010. Green jobs were\na small proportion of total private sector jobs in the nation and in our\nstate.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: U.S. & PA Green Jobs, 2010\n\n\n\nThe percentages of green jobs in the U.S. and Commonwealth were\nsimilar – and low – within most industries. However, over one–third of\nall jobs in Pennsylvania’s utilities industry were classified as green,\nwhich is 3.1 times the concentration of green jobs in this industry than\nin the entire U.S. utilities industry. Also, green jobs were 2.5 times\nmore concentrated in Pennsylvania transportation and warehousing – and\n1.9 times more concentrated in the professional, technical, and service\nindustry – than in the entire nation.\nThe count of Pennsylvania’s 182,200 green jobs in 2010 ranked fourth\namong the six states with greater than 100,000 green jobs. These, and\nthe 2.3 million U.S. green jobs in 2010 counted by the BLS, are not\nnecessarily net new jobs, a factor which has limited the anticipated\nimpact of the development of green jobs on the nation’s employment\npicture.\nFor example, using the BLS data, the Pennsylvania Center for\nWorkforce Information and Analysis estimated that the Pittsburgh area\ncontained 18,000 green jobs in 2010. “I would not say we’ve had 18,000\nnew jobs in new categories,” Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Three Rivers\nWorkforce Investment Board told the Pittsburgh Post–Gazette. “It’s kind\nof a ‘greening’ of existing jobs with some select growth in the\nindustry.”\nMany observers are skeptical that government targeted funds for green\njob training are anything more than a boondoggle. State Budget\nSolutions, a self–described “non-partisan, positive, pro–reform,\nproactive” project, produced a report, “Green Jobs Don’t Grow on Trees,”\nin which was noted that “Pennsylvania is learning firsthand that\nincreasing the number of green workers does not automatically increase\nemployment. The state’s federally–funded MOVE-IT program cost $1.4\nmillion and initially graduated 113 people, of whom only thirty-five\nwere able to find a job. Rather than helping people find work, the\nprogram has merely turned over 75 out-of-work citizens into green\nout-of-work citizens.”\nAs senior policy analyst Kermit the Frog often sings, “It’s not easy\nbeing green.”\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nThis essay, written with Rose M. Baker, originally was published in\nMarcellus Business Central on October 7, 2011 (Volume 1, Issue\n5, pages 9 and 15) when natural gas development in Pennsylvania started\nin earnest and\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hydraulic Fracturing\n\n\n\nMany Pennsylvanians are confused about clashes of findings between\ntwo prominent studies of the economic impacts of Marcellus Shale\ndevelopment in Pennsylvania.\nOne report was published during August by the Marcellus Shale\nEducation and Training Center (MSETC), a collaboration between\nPennsylvania College of Technology and Penn State Extension (Kelsey et al. 2009). MSETC estimated\nthat Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania generated between\n23,385 and 23,884 jobs and almost $1.9 billion in regional gross\ndomestic product in 2009.\nAnother report, published during late July, is the third in a series\nof reports authored by researchers, working through Penn State’s John\nand Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering,\nabout the status, impact, and potential of Pennsylvania’s Marcellus\nnatural gas industry (Considine, Watson, and Blumsack 2010).\nBy way of contrast with the report by MSETC, this study estimated that\nPennsylvania Marcellus natural gas development generated $11.2 billion\nin regional gross domestic product and supported nearly 140,000 jobs\nduring 2010.\nThe magnitude of the differences between the outcomes of the MSETC\nand Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering studies is too large to\nbe attributed to the differences between 2009 and 2010 in the\nPennsylvania economy and in the level of the natural gas industry’s\nactivity. Much of the comparison in the popular press between the two\nstudies has surrounded who funded and conducted the studies.\nThe MSETC study was funded by the Pennsylvania Economic Development\nFinancing Authority. Three of its authors work for Penn State, with help\nfrom a former Penn State faculty member now working in Colorado.\nThe Marcellus Shale Coalition funded the research leading to the\nstudy reported from the Penn State Department of Energy and Mineral\nEngineering. The Coalition is registered in Pennsylvania as a 501(c)(6)\ntax exempt organization that represents the natural gas industry to the\ngovernment, regulators, and the public. Most of the authors of this\nstudy are not affiliated with Penn State. One author is a former Penn\nState professor and another is a retired Penn State professor, while a\nthird is current Penn State professor.\nMany people refer to both studies as “Penn State” studies, although\nyou can be certain that there is no such thing as a common, sanctioned\nPenn State position on Marcellus Shale development around which all\nfaculty researchers rally. As one of our colleagues observed, over 3,500\nfull–time professors are employed by Penn State, guaranteeing also that\nthere could be over 3,500 independent postures and attitudes about\nMarcellus Shale at Penn State, some of which change daily.\nThink the University has one voice on Marcellus Shale? Think\nagain.\nMany commentators dismiss the Coalition–funded study as the product\nof biased analysis conducted by hacks hired for industry lobbyists and,\nthen, laundered with a Penn State logo to simulate the patina of\nscholarly gravitas. The MSETC report has received little criticism yet,\neven though it, too, was funded by a government agency with skin in the\ngame.\nReceiving research funds from sources external to the University is\nquite common. Research is an added expense that has social benefits\nbeyond the University and, for the most part, is unfunded in the\nUniversity’s core budget. Also, modern science is conducted worldwide\namong collaborators, with little attention to institutional boundaries.\nNo one should be surprised that research at universities primarily is\nfunded externally and is conducted collaboratively.\nSo, we believe that criticizing these studies based on who funded and\nconducted them is the wrong approach to assessing their quality. Rather,\nthe studies must be judged on their scientific merits.\nFirst, let’s examine the analytical foundation that runs through both\nstudies.\nThe MSETC study and the Coalition–funded study investigated economic\nimpacts using IMPLAN (most recent citation: “Economic Impact\nAnalysis for Planning | IMPLAN” 2019), a highly\nquantitative, computationally-intensive macroeconomic model that is\nconsidered by many to be the gold standard1 for\nassessing the economy–wide outcomes of regional economic activities,\ndevelopments, and events. We use IMPLAN in our own research.\nAs many commentators have noted, IMPLAN has a variety of assumptions\nand limitations, requires mathematical skill to use correctly, is\ncomplex, and often is misapplied.2 However, the authors of\nboth the MSETC study and the Coalition–funded study demonstrate the\nexperience and accomplishment of grizzled IMPLAN users who are quite\ncompetent in specifying, conducting, and reporting IMPLAN analyses.\nNow, down to the actual analytical differences between the MSETC\nstudy and the Coalition–funded study.\nFrom our view, the differences in study outcomes are driven by some\nkey differences in the numbers entered into IMPLAN for each study. As\nthe authors of the MSETC study asserted, these differences in outcomes\nare due to differences in “detailed information on where leasing,\nroyalty, and payroll were going.”\nThe Coalition–funded study assumed that all lease and royalty income\nearned through natural gas development and production remains within\nPennsylvania and, furthermore, is spent during the year in which it is\nreceived. However, these assumptions do not seem reasonable.\nSome of this lease and royalty income “leaks” outside the\nCommonwealth and much is saved rather than spent. Based on data\ncollected from Pennsylvania households and businesses, MSETC assumed\nconservatively that between 7.7 and 15.4% of lease and royalty dollars\nare earned out–of–state. MSETC’s data also led to the assumption that\nlandowners save, rather than spend, 55% of lease payments and 66% of\nroyalty payments.\nThe evidence-fueled assumptions by MSETC of lower lease and royalty\nincome spent in the state and more lease and royalty income saved for\nthe future produce lower economic impacts than those estimated in the\nCoalition–funded study.\nThe Coalition–funded study assumed that the payroll of Marcellus\nShale workers was earned and spent by Pennsylvanians alone. The MSETC\nstudy applied data from surveys and other studies to make the\nassumptions that 37% of Marcellus Shale workers are not Pennsylvania\nresidents and that these non–residents spent between 50 to 75% of their\nearnings in Pennsylvania on a more restricted set of purchases (e.g.,\nfocusing on food and lodging) than Pennsylvanians do.\nMSETC’s assumptions of fewer Marcellus Shale earnings spent in\nPennsylvania on a limited set of purchases equal lower economic impact\nestimates than produced through the Coalition–funded study.\nThe full story of the net economic impact of Marcellus Shale activity\nremains to be told.^[Not much action to research these impacts since the\nthese early squabbles about potential economic outcomes from developing\nand producing gas from Marcellus Shale formations. I believe that this\nis because the representatives no longer seem threatened by the\npossibility of a severance tax, which Pennsylvania never has had the\npolitical will to enact. ] However, at this point, the MSETC study\nappears to us to be more credible scientifically and practically than\nthe Coalition–funded study.\n\n[1] \"2022-04-26 07:13:00 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.
