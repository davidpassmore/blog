(n.d.a), a Wexford, Pennsylvania,\ndeveloper of technology solutions for distribution centers, commissioned\na study of 500 on-floor warehouse workers across multiple geographies\nand job roles in the U.S. An eight-page brochure, Voice of the\nWarehouse Worker Insights (Lucas Systems, Inc. 2022a), reported\nfindings of the study designed to identify “how workers feel about\nstress, the need for technology, and working with robots” [Lucas Systems, Inc.\n(2022b), para. 3 ).\n\nThe Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring\nexciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks\nand seasonal special events.\n\nSurvey Findings\nA statement (Berardi, n.d.)\ndistributed on June 29, 2022 announcing the brochure’s release indicated\nthat\n\n“Nearly 3 out of 4…on-floor workers said they would consider a pay\ncut at another company for an opportunity to use technology if it helps\nthem in their job. Workers also said they are physically spent, spending\nover a third of their day walking and would welcome tech’s help in the\nform of robots or other tech tools.”\n\nA concentration of younger workers – 81% of Generation Z1 workers responding to the survey –\nwas at least somewhat likely “to trade tech for pay” (Lucas Systems,\nInc. 2022a, 2). Note that this is not a sentiment to accept a\npay cut in a current job, but to consider lower than current pay in an\nentirely new job.\nThis finding is not unique. For instance, Mas and Pallais (2017) found that the average national\ncall center worker was willing to give up 20% of wages to avoid a\nschedule set by an employer on short notice and 8% of wages for the\noption to work from home. For another example, Yong (2022) reported that a poll conducted in\nthe Philippines showed that 73% of respondents would forgo a pay raise\nor promotion for better work-life balance, overall well-being, and\nhappiness.\nOther Findings\nOther conclusions extracted from the brochure released by Lucas\nSystems include (Berardi 2022, para.\n5):\nWorkers want to stay with their employer but feel improvements are\nnecessary to make their jobs easier. Workers generally anticipate\nstaying at their current employer for at least three years (74%) with\n35% anticipating a tenure longer than five years.\n75% of workers say physical strain in their jobs takes a larger toll\non them than the mental strain. The leading cause of physical strain is\ncarrying and/or lifting followed by walking and/or traveling.\nTop causes of mental strain include meeting performance or incentive\ngoals and objectives (25%) and safely maneuvering around the warehouse\n(20%).\nWorkers see robots as productive allies but fear increased quotas.\nMore than 2 in 5 believe robots will reduce physical stress (46%) or\nhelp them achieve better speed in item picking (44%) or better accuracy\n(40%).\nLucas\nSystems, Inc. (2022a) declared that: technology tools\nare essential to the well-being and retention of workers; training is\nvital to the adoption of technology tools; and gradual introduction of\nworkers to technology tools is necessary (p. 8).\nPerhaps a Broader Meaning\nExists\nCertainly is interesting information is presented in the brochure\ndistributed by Lucas Systems, information that points to the value\nproposition for products that Lucas Systems manufactures.2 I\nwish I could examine documentation about the collection, organization,\nand analysis of the survey data. Even so, the information from the Lucas\nSystems’ survey stimulates assessment of the floating meanings of work\nand pay as our economy suffers through a lingering pandemic, is besieged\nby political division and unrest, and is buffeted by war and rumors of\nwar, all factors that have collided to hobble worldwide supply chains\nfor human and capital resources.\nThe Work and Pay Plexus\nA Very Narrow View\nTaking a narrow, pecuniary view, pay originates from a transaction,\nan exchange of time and effort by workers for money from the owners of\ncapital. The owners of physical capital buy human capital for\nproduction. A commodity exchange. The workers are as interchangeable as\nthe paper currency they receive. Neat. Separate. Symmetrical. But,\nlargely a theoretical characterization.\nBuyers and sellers meet at a price. Labor supply, then, is the amount\nand kind of labor that is available at a given wage. Need more labor?\nIncrease the wage. What is the optimal wage? Just enough to supply the\nhuman capital for production. All following the textbook, right? Almost\nas lawful as, say, Archimedes’ Buoyancy Principle. Now, before you yell\n“Eureka!” and run naked through the streets of Syracuse as Archimedes\ndid when he noticed that he displaced water when he sat in the tub,\nconsider that the concept of pay is more knotty and involuted than you\nfirst might have thought.\nWell, Maybe a Little More\nThan That?\nLet’s crack the stern exterior of the wage-labor theory of exchange\nwith a dose of economic reality. Some economists have acknowledged that\neven the sequence of “worth-as-pay-as-money” can incorporate\nnon-pecuniary elements. In Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote\nin 1776:\n\n“The wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness\nor dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness of the employment.\nThus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman tailor earns less\nthan a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver\nearns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but\nit is much cleanlier. A journeyman blacksmith, though an artificer,\nseldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier, who is only a\nlabourer, does in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less\ndangerous, and is carried on in daylight, and above ground. Honour makes\na great part of the reward of all honourable professions. In point of\npecuniary gain, all things considered, they are generally\nunder-recompensed….Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade of a\nbutcher is a brutal and an odious business; but it is in most places\nmore profitable than the greater part of common trades. The most\ndetestable of all employments, that of public executioner, is, in\nproportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common\ntrade whatever.” (A. Smith\n(1776), Book 1,\nChapter 10, para. 5)\n\nIn practice, economists identify this type of variation in pay as a\ncompensating differential (R. S. Smith 1979, 339). These\ndifferentials are higher wages that are paid to workers who perform jobs\nthat have particular hazards or other unpleasant features associated\nwith them. Some examples are: premium pay for working second- or\nthird-shift work schedules; hazard pay for combat, police protection, or\nfire service; higher pay for underground coal miners exposed to the risk\nof injury and lung disease; or pay differences by geographic region that\nreflect costs of living differences or remoteness of location. The role\nof a compensating differential is to maintain a supply of labor in\nchallenging conditions that might otherwise depress interest in\nacquiring or staying in a job.\nWorkers have their own ways of differentiating compensation. Workers\ncan react negatively when faced with pay cuts in their own jobs,\nespecially when the reasons for the cuts are not judged by workers as\nreasonable (Chen and Horton\n2016). For example, Coviello, Deserranno, and Persico (2022) described\na pay cut at a call center that was motivated by cost-cutting, not by\nlower productivity of call center employees. Some workers quit. Others,\nthough, engaged in counterproductive behavior that hurt the firm as well\nas the pay of commission-driven employees. Some workers, especially\nthose among with the highest expressed loyalty and longest work tenure,\nintentionally sold the wrong items, as opposed to simply optimally\nshirking on effort in response to the pay cut.\nGreenberg (2001) observed\nwhat he described as “reciprocal deviance,” that is, employees’\nperceptions that their employers’ defaults on their obligations\nencouraged employees to respond with similar acts of deviance. In\nparticular, theft (termed, in a Orwellian sense, “shrinkage” in retail\nindustries) rose during a period in which pay was temporarily reduced by\n15%. In some cases, pay cuts to current workers can be more disruptive\nthat downsizing the numbers of employees (Yoon 2017). Pay not only produces buying\npower but also becomes a measure of self-worth and respect from\nothers.\nConsistent with the findings from the survey by Lucas Systems,\nresearch on variation in wages and salaries reveals that workers and\nemployers see more meaning in pay than just plan money.\nIs That All There Is?\nFrom a macro perspective, the meaning of work is a shared cultural\nconcept associated with values, beliefs, and norms. Among individual\nworkers, though, the meaning of work is variegated, contextual, and\nidiosyncratic. According to Rothausen and Henderson (2019),\n\nJobs can fulfill (or not fulfill) basic human needs (some would say\nrights) for dignity in work, meaningful work, and some level of economic\njustice. Jobs also affect workers’ lives, and thus their worlds,\nfundamentally….Therefore, key meanings of work spring from basic human\nneeds from work, and from workers’ larger worlds, and these elements\nlikely impact workers’ satisfaction related to their jobs. (p. 359)\n\nPay is not the only return to investment of time and efforts in work.\nSeen broadly, work permits the expression of talents, empowers the\ndevelopment of self, offers friendship and social relations, and affords\na transcendent role in a collective contribution to an endeavor larger\nthan self (see (Rothausen and Henderson\n2019, Table 2)). This many-sided, complex perspective is a\nkey attribute running through manifold theoretical perspectives and\nempirical research streams focusing on the meaning of work that human\nbeings seek. “Overall job satisfaction is the sum of the evaluations of\nthe discriminable elements of which the job is composed” (Locke 1969, 330). Pay alone is not the\nsole factor that draws and retains a worker to a job.\nSo, perhaps the respondents to the Lucas Systems’ survey who said\nthey would consider a pay cut are weighing bundles of non-pecuniary\nattributes of potential jobs as important enough to compensate for lower\npay.\nHuh? A Pay Cut?\nYep. A Cut Might Fulfill\nBroader Needs\nAlthough accepting or seeking a pay cut might seem like an error in\njudgment, workers might view the trade-off of pay for other\nnon-pecuniary returns to work as a way to maintain or increase the\nsubjective utility of work to satisfy their many diverse wants. In this\nway, seeking or accepting a pay cut might be viewed as a rational\ndecision to achieve a satisfaction balance in life.\nAs Blanchflower\nand Oswald (2017) found, having a job is an\nessential determinant of satisfaction with life, no matter what income\nlevel a person has attained. In what is almost a transcendent conception\nof work, Coleman and\nRamsey (2021), career coaches, consider a\npaycheck as a “clear path to doing work you love” (the subtitle of their\nbook). Our personal experience can attest to the belief that money is\nbut one form of compensation. Of course, the role of money in our lives\ncannot be dismissed entirely. Clark (2018) concluded that an almost\nuniversally accepted research outcome in studies of the economics of\nhappiness is that “individuals who are observed to have higher levels of\nincome in cross-section data also report higher levels of subjective\nwell-being” (Section 2.1).\nProfits Are at an\nAll-Time High – Why Not Share?\nMany observers wonder why pay cuts are even necessary while corporate\nprofits are at a 70-year high (profits over time are displayed in Figure\n1). The Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond (2021) found that 80% of firms increased\nprices to cover the higher costs of inputs during recent pandemic and\ninflationary periods. Also, the economic chaos during these periods\noffered opportunities to raise profit margins beyond the increase in\ncosts, especially among larger firms. For instance, a 2022 survey of\n1,000 retailers revealed that over one-half of respondents raised prices\nbeyond rising costs and offered fewer or no discounts during the holiday\nseason (“More Than Half of\nRetail Businesses Are Using Inflation to Price Gouge”\n2022).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: U.S. Quarterly Corporate Business Profits After\nTaxes, 1952-2022.  (billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted;\ngraphic created from Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis (n.d.).)\n\n\n\nReasons given from the employers’ side for not sharing this high rate\nof profitability with workers include:\nProfits are distributed to shareholders, the owners of\nfirms.\nSharing profits with workers transforms profit into an\nexpense.\nProfits, although perhaps high at the moment, are just returns to\nlong-term investment.\nIn short, it’s ours, not yours.\nFitting with these reasons, workers’ share of income from production\nhas declined steadily. A 2019 McKinsey Global Institute report (Manyika et al. 2019a.) documented the\ndecline in labor’s share of income in the United States. Although\nlabor’s share already had started to decrease in the 1960s, McKinsey\nestimated that three-fourths of the entire post-1947 decline occurred\nbetween 2000 and 2016 (see trends in Figure 2). The\nsteepest part of the decline – from 63.3% in 2000 to 56.7% in 2016 –\nfollowed a moderate downward drift in the 1980s and early 1990s, and a\nslight recovery in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: McKinsey Global Institute Estimate of Declining\nLabor Share of Income in the United States  (Graphic from Manyika et al. (2019a).)\n\n\n\nManyika et al. (2019b) even\nmore narrowly attributed this decline to specific industrial\nsectors:\n\nTwelve sectors that make up about one-third of employment and 44\npercent of economic output explain the overall decline in labor share or\nincrease in capital share. These sectors represent a broad and diverse\nset of economic activities. They are: mining and quarrying;\nconstruction; real estate; coke and refined petroleum; motor vehicles;\npharmaceuticals and chemicals; computer, electronics, and optical\nproducts; publishing, audiovisual, and telecom; computer programming and\nconsulting; information services; wholesale and retail, and\ntransportation and storage. [emphasis mine] (Part 2)\n\nImprovements in technology in these 12 sectors led to the\nsubstitution of capital for labor and the creation of intangible and\nintellectual products that have faster depreciation cycles than for\ntangible equipment. These factors helped transportation and storage\nfirms, a subsection of which Lucas Systems serves, join in the 12\nsectors that accounted for the largest declines in the labor share of\nincome. The findings of the survey by Lucas Systems indicate that\nworkers also might see some advantages to the capital-labor substitution\nthat can help rationalize their sentiments about trading pay cuts for\nincreasing technology at work.\nBut, Wait, Isn’t It the\nEconomy, Stupid?\n“It’s the economy, stupid” was a widely-quoted catchphrase\nauthored by James Carville, a strategist in Bill Clinton’s successful\n1992 campaign for U.S. President, to remind campaign workers to stay on\nmessage. Thinking along these lines, perhaps it is a mistake to\nover-analyze the willingness of workers to accept lower pay with\nanything other than ordinary concepts of supply and demand. Maybe it is\njust that….the economy?\nThe U.S. economy has faced what some people have called The Great\nResignation, but perhaps a better characterization is The Great\nReshuffle. Job openings and job quitting have been at all-time\nhighs for months, while layoffs fell to a record low. Employers raised\nwages to attract workers. All while the threats to traditional work\narrangements from the pandemic were pervasive. Yet, about one-half of\njob quitters did not drop out of the workforce. They quit to move to new\njobs.\nWillis Towers Watson polled 9,658 U.S. employees from large and\nmidsize private employers across a broad range of industries in December\n2021 and January 2022 (Willis Towers\nWatson 2021). Over half of workers (56%) said pay is a top\nreason they would look for a job with a different employer. Forty-one\npercent would leave for a 5% increase. But almost 20% said they’d take a\nnew job for the same pay — suggesting factors other than wages are\nimportant, too – as respondents to the survey from Lucas Systems\nindicated. Health benefits, job security, flexible work arrangements and\nretirement benefits were behind pay, respectively, as the top five\nreasons employees would move elsewhere. Many survey respondents\nexpressed preferences for remote work just as employers were encouraging\nworkers to return on-site to the office.\nAs a result, the economy has featured an almost unprecedented\nsellers’ market for labor. Elting (2021) summarized the critical elements\nof the current unique market for labor:\n\nEmployers must compete for workers because there are far more open\nslots than job applicants, and workers are smart enough to recognize\nthat. Yes, they’re voting with their feet in favor of more flexible work\nhours, continued availability of remote work, higher wages, and better\ntreatment, but the context that makes that possible, the basic calculus\nof supply and demand in the labor market, goes ignored. There are a lot\nof jobs and people are re-entering the labor market with reluctance and\nrecalculating their options.\n\nSo, it is the economy, after all. The demand for labor\npost-pandemic was driven by the release of pent-up consumer demand. The\nneed for workers to return to work ran head-on into reluctance to return\ndue to such matters as the unavailability of child care. Time away from\nwork and COVID stimulus checks to households during the pandemic offered\ntime and income buffers for workers to ponder whether retirement was\nbest or whether they wanted to seek or train for new work that might\nraise their subjective well–being.\nIn a way, the pandemic and the disruption around it ironically\ncreated an opportunities for workers. One door closes, another opens,\nallowing a kind of creative destruction that becomes possible during\nperiods of change and chaos.\n\nA working class hero is something to be.\n~ John Lennon\n\n\nStarter Fluid for This July 4 Posting\nAn-Li Herring,\nreporter for 90.5 WESA-FM Pittsburgh NPR, conducted an interview with me\nabout the brochure summarizing the findings from the survey that was\ndistributed by Lucas Systems and, then, incorporated the interview into\nher article, “Survey: As online ordering grows, warehouse workers say\nthey need more tech to save their bodies” (Herring 2022).

Although the entire webinar\nwas informative and throught-provoking,1 I\nfound that three slides encasulated well the components of inflationary\nand deflationary dynamics and their differential effects on various\nsocial and economic classes. Then, summarized on two slides are the\nresults of simulations a 10% hike in the price of oil that Fred\nshared.\n\nDynamics of Inflation\nVarious forces can increase or decrease consumer prices in complex\nways. Monetary policy is the process by which a government,\ncentral bank, or monetary authority manages the supply of money, or\ntrading in foreign exchange markets. Fiscal policy attempts to\ninfluence the direction of the economy through changes in government\nspending or taxes. On top of these policies, severe supply-chain\ndisruptions and labor shortages have added to inflationary\npressures.\n\n\n\nTechnology can make production more efficient.\nGlobalization promotes trade with low-cost producers.\nAging involves changing the amount and kind of consumption.\nRemote work reduces costs of transportation and improves access\nto labor independent of geography.\n\n\n\nSimply put, inflation degrades the well-being of lower income groups\nmore than higher income and wealthy groups. Lower income groups spend a\nhigh proportion of their cash on necessities than higher income/wealth\ngroups, which have more cushion to buy higher priced necessities and\ndiscretionary consumption\n\n\n\nRole of\nTransportation in Inflation and Deflation\nTransportation is a major and direct driver of labor productivity.\nTransportation impediments have dented our supply chain significantly.\nLabor shortages amplify these transportation difficulties.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of stagflation is a worry. A period of slow\neconomic growth and high unemployment (i.e., stagnation) can combine\nwith rising prices (i.e., inflation) to create a recession(i.e., a\nbusiness cycle contraction when there is a general decline in overall\neconomic activity).\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: I am not a shill for REMI.

When this essay was\npublished, the term “green jobs,” was prominent in policy and public\ndiscussions. Interestingly, as I post this item, the Russia;s war on\nUkraine has made alternate energy futures a hot topic again.\n\nHey, remember green jobs? Looks like Pennsylvania has some.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor, green jobs are slightly more concentrated in\nPennsylvania than in the entire U.S., not only among all private sector\njobs, but also within some industries.\nBut, you might ask, as many people have continued to do, what are\ngreen jobs? Certainly, a good working definition of green jobs could\nlead to good measurements of green job counts and opportunities, which\nare critical to national and regional economic policy development,\neconomic research and planning, and education and training\ninvestment.\nThe definition of green jobs, however, rarely has been clear.\nFor example, in his book, “The Green Collar Economy,” Van Jones —\none-time Obama “Special Policy Advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and\nInnovation” — defined green jobs as “good local jobs that pay well,\nstrengthen communities, provide pathways out of poverty, and help solve\nenvironmental problems.” Phil Angelides, chair of Apollo Alliance, a\ncoalition of industry, labor, and environmental groups, once said that\ngreen jobs are characterized by “decent wages and benefits that can\nsupport a family. It has to be part of a real career path, with upward\nmobility.”\nIn response, we fist pump, “Rah! Rah!,” of course. Yet, most\ndefinitions of green jobs offered when the green economy was the policy\nleitmotif–of–the–month are not specific enough to guide labor market\nstrategies, policies, and tactics.\nThe BLS tackled head–on the thorny and controversial problem of\ndefining green jobs which has vexed and confused policy discussions\nabout transforming our vast and varied economy to be more\nenvironmentally conscious and energy conserving.\nThe BLS used two approaches to defining green jobs and, then, to\nmeasuring green jobs through a mail survey of U.S. establishments. The\ncommon thread in these two approaches is that green jobs preserve or\nrestore the environment.\nFirst, some green jobs make green goods and services.\nThe BLS counted jobs as “green” at establishments producing goods and\nservices that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.\nWorkers in these jobs produce energy from renewable sources, make\nproducts that improve energy efficiency, abate pollution, reduce\ngreenhouse gasses, recycle or reuse products, conserve natural\nresources, or encourage compliance with environmental regulations and\ngood practices through education, training, and public awareness.\nSecond, the BLS counted jobs through which workers make their own\nestablishments’ work processes more environmentally friendly or use\nfewer natural resources. Workers in these green jobs use energy from\nrenewable sources which is generated through efficient technologies and\npractices. And, these workers employ processes that abate pollution or\nthat conserve natural resources.\nDisplayed in Figure 1 are percentages of green jobs\nwithin private sector industries in the U.S. and in Pennsylvania during\n2010. Green jobs were a small proportion of total private sector jobs in\nthe nation and in our state.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: U.S. & PA Green Jobs, 2010\n\n\n\nThe percentages of green jobs in the U.S. and Commonwealth were\nsimilar – and low – within most industries. However, over one–third of\nall jobs in Pennsylvania’s utilities industry were classified as green,\nwhich is 3.1 times the concentration of green jobs in this industry than\nin the entire U.S. utilities industry. Also, green jobs were 2.5 times\nmore concentrated in Pennsylvania transportation and warehousing – and\n1.9 times more concentrated in the professional, technical, and service\nindustry – than in the entire nation.\nThe count of Pennsylvania’s 182,200 green jobs in 2010 ranked fourth\namong the six states with greater than 100,000 green jobs. These, and\nthe 2.3 million U.S. green jobs in 2010 counted by the BLS, are not\nnecessarily net new jobs, a factor which has limited the anticipated\nimpact of the development of green jobs on the nation’s employment\npicture.\nFor example, using the BLS data, the Pennsylvania Center for\nWorkforce Information and Analysis estimated that the Pittsburgh area\ncontained 18,000 green jobs in 2010. “I would not say we’ve had 18,000\nnew jobs in new categories,” Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Three Rivers\nWorkforce Investment Board told the Pittsburgh Post–Gazette. “It’s kind\nof a ‘greening’ of existing jobs with some select growth in the\nindustry.”\nMany observers are skeptical that government targeted funds for green\njob training are anything more than a boondoggle. State Budget\nSolutions, a self–described “non-partisan, positive, pro–reform,\nproactive” project, produced a report, “Green Jobs Don’t Grow on Trees,”\nin which was noted that “Pennsylvania is learning firsthand that\nincreasing the number of green workers does not automatically increase\nemployment. The state’s federally–funded MOVE-IT program cost $1.4\nmillion and initially graduated 113 people, of whom only thirty-five\nwere able to find a job. Rather than helping people find work, the\nprogram has merely turned over 75 out-of-work citizens into green\nout-of-work citizens.”\nAs senior policy analyst Kermit the Frog often sings,\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-06-23 16:43:42 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.
