    "contents": "\nBack in 1978 – when I worked for ten months, two weeks, and ten hours\nfor the University of Northern Iowa – I traveled to Washington about one\nday per week to work as a consultant to YouthWork, a private\nintermediary firm between the U.S. Department of Labor and local\ngovernments with funds from the Comprehensive Employment and Training\nAct.\nNorthern Iowa also asked me to meet with various politicians when I\nwas in Washington. That is how I met then-Representative Chuck Grassley\nfrom Iowa, who is now United States Senator Chuck Grassley from\nIowa.\nChuck Grassley is now the senior United States Senator from Iowa. He\nis a member of the Republican Party. During the last four decades in the\nSenate, Grassley has chaired the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate\nNarcotics Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate\nAging Committee. He is a graduate, with two degrees, from the University\nof Northern Iowa.\nChuck (yes, he prefers Chuck) took me to lunch at a\nrestaurant in the Capitol Building. Its specialty is Capitol Hill Bean\nSoup, which I ordered and enjoyed.\nBefore lunch even began, we launched into a debate about the role of\ndairy products in the Consumer Price Index, which was the subject of a\nNew York Times front-page article just several days before. To my great\nsurprise, he was knowledgeable about the issue, understood the Consumer\nPrice Index, and had a definite opinion that differed remarkably from\nmine about the relative weight of dairy products in the Index\ncalculation. We debated for about ten minutes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: On the Capitol Steps, 1978\n\n\n\nHe was testing me, I think. He warmed considerably after that debate\nas we talked about his farm, our families, and Iowa. It was a great\nmeeting, after which we had a photograph in Fig.\n1 taken on the Capitol Building steps.\nI know these “grip-and-grin” photos are stock,\n“for-the-visiting-rubes” items, but I did appreciate receiving this\nmomento of our meeting that this photo represents. We had a great time\nat lunch so many years ago. I know some of you might have issues with\nGrassley’s voting record and politics, but I think he was honest and\nstraightforward with his dealings. And he usually chose his positions\nbased on his convictions and beliefs – and he rarely wavered. There is\nsomething admirable about that.\nAdded when I reposted this essay on my current blog:\nYet, what a shock it was for me to see Chuck parrot the Trump\nGreat Lie. Discouraging. Deflating. Impossible to view him as I\ndid in 1978.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-06-23 16:52:11 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\nBianca, 1996-2007…\nIt was a sad day on which I had to take our white greyhound, Bianca,\nto the vet for her final walk. When she was two years old, we acquired\nher from a person in the Pittsburgh area who placed retired racing\ngreyhounds into good homes. She lived with us and at least three other\nof our hounds (two now deceased and one still lounging by the fire at\nthis very moment).\nBianca had a good home here. She was a good dog, too. Never once did\nshe perform an aggressive act. No biting. No growling. No underhanded\ndeeds. No stealing the bologna when no one was looking. Grandchildren\nslept on her without a wiggle from her in response. You dog owners know\nhow rare this is.\nTo be sure, Bianca was fearful of things. Thunder. Loud, sudden\nnoises. Shouting people. Just like people are. But, so few moments bring\nreal sadness. Good, crunchy food, topped by a dollop of gooey, soft\nmeat: That’s the way to happiness. Long naps in a cool breeze or beside\nthe hearth, all warm and glowing. A sharp, playful bark. A run and a\ntussle in the yard. A stitch or two when she ran on something sharp.\nJust like the rest of us sentient beings.\nSentient beings.\nDogs are, don’t you think, the perfect Zen entities? They place great\nimportance on moment-by-moment awareness and seeing deeply into the\nnature of things by direct experience. Dogs as Zen masters. Look deeply\ninto those inscrutable eyes. Do you see fear? Is there attention and\ninterest? Is there being and nothingness? Well, maybe nothing so deep. I\nalways felt that dogs had three wires in the brain: sex, food, sleep.\nAll else is just there.\nIn the end, it was osteosarcoma in her leg that did her in.\nMetastasized to her lungs. Yesterday or the day before, she probably\nexperienced a pathological leg fracture. She could not walk well at all.\nShe was awake all night, panting and restless. She slept most of today\nunder pain medication.\nNow was the time as we had planned with the vet weeks before.\nThis is the seventh dog I have taken to the vet to be put down. The\nfirst time was when I went with my father to have my first dog, Duke,\nput down. The vet wanted me to leave. My father had the wisdom to tell\nhim I could stay if I wanted. Staying became so important because I was\nsure, as only a silly 12-year old can be, that the vet was really just\nfaking it. He would take my Heinz 57 Variety dog, which I\nthought was the most beautiful big brown dog in the world, and give him\nto someone else. The dog had arrived two years before, and, as an only\nchild, he often was my only companion. The experience of taking a dog on\nits final walk since has never been easy, but it has been necessary.\nAs with most of the others (Duke, Cookie, Dolly, Sparky, Sophie,\nLewis), it was just me in the room with Bianca and the vet. I held her\nhead in my hands on my lap and reminded her that every dog has its day.\nAnd, then, she folded into the cold and damp night to a sleep so quiet\nthat all air and light seemed to freeze around me. The last walk through\nthe door, my companion. Feel free to canter ahead gaily.\nTo my surprise, tears rolled down the vet’s face. He told me that,\njust the year before, his wife had died of osteosarcoma. The vet\nconfessed that he wished he could have taken away her pain as he had\njust done with Bianca.\nHere is a picture that my daughter, Ann, took as Bianca slept in the\nbright sun, in her favorite spot, in the back yard, in the snow:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bianca loved napping in the snow on a sunny day\n\n\n\nAnd, here, another photo a few minutes before I took her to the\nvet:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Curled up like greyhounds do\n\n\n\n\nYou think dogs will not be in heaven? I tell you, they will be there\nlong before any of us. ~Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nAdded years After\nThis Original 2007 Posting\nSo, in honor of my dear little white dog, Bianca, and all of her\nfour-legged friends of men, women, and children, I offer my reading of\nLawrence Ferlinghetti’s poem, Dog:\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-06-23 16:51:05 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\nWhen I was about eight years old, my parents took me to the Erie\nCounty Fair in Hamburg, New York. Lots of farm equipment, farm animals,\nand a midway. I won this blue dog ashtray by landing a tossed ping-pong\nball in a fishbowl:\n\nI could have had the live fish, but I took the cheap ceramic dog on\nthe edge of the ashtray instead. This little blue dog with sad eyes has\nsat on my dresser for years. He held bits of pencils, knives, chewing\ngum, and later, as you can see from the burn marks, cones of incense. He\nwas dusted once or twice over the years. The yellow discoloration on him\nis from my parent’s 2 packs-a-day (each) smoking.\nThis little dog is a figure in one of the most meaningful dreams of\nmy life.\nWhen I was a junior in high school, my father came home from work via\nthe emergency room one day. A large steel plate, the size of a piece of\nstandard plywood sheeting, had grazed the front of his body. He had cuts\non his face and bruises all down his body where the plate had fallen\nforward and scraped him. Luckily he wasn’t underneath the plate.\nMy father worked hard. He had been a personnel and safety director of\nhis battery manufacturing plant. Many men were released from work when\nthe firm was purchased by an automobile manufacturer. He was fortunate\nto be rehired in the place he had started years before–as a laborer.\nHe plowed snow. He shoveled keystone (very fine-grain coal),\nsometimes for an entire day, guiding the gritty black stuff from a rail\ncar into a silo. He would return home exhausted. Coal-black. In need of\na single shot of Black Velvet, some dinner, and some sleep. I don’t\nthink he ever made over $10,000 per year, even though he amassed\nconsiderable overtime.\nFunny, although he had been a member of the management, he was\nrehired to work side by side with many of the people he originally had\nhired and supervised. Then, he became president of the union.\nEventually, he served on the state workers’ compensation board, where I\nfirst learned from perusing his meeting minutes what an arm, leg, eye,\nor life was worth in compensatory terms.\nWell, the steel plate accident was the straw that broke the camel’s\nback. His health began to deteriorate. It became difficult for him to\nwalk. He seemed disoriented. Clearly, something was wrong. He filed for\na disability retirement when he was 55 years old.\nThat was not an easy time. My father’s company, for which he had\nworked for 38 years, denied his disability retirement claim and tried to\nblame his current difficulties on a wartime injury. He had broken his\nfemur while jumping on an Army truck. We were without money of any sort\ncoming in. The government denied that he had a claim against them. His\ncompany refused to budge. My parents used the last of their savings.\nThey sold their war bonds. They cashed in their life insurance. I never\nreally saw my mother cry so bitterly at the injustice of it all. My\nfather was very sad.\nAs a teenager, you don’t know what to make of the world around you\ncrumbling. Moreover, you don’t know what to say. You just watch.\nQuietly. Keep your thoughts to yourself. Indignity after indignity was\nexperienced by my people who always paid their way but, now, were\nwithout resources. My uncle brought us food.\nI wondered, where were those people to whom my father took clothes\nand food when he was a member of the St. Vincent De Paul Society? Where\nwere the nuns and priests of the church he had served for years and for\nwhom I had been a faithful altar boy since I was 10 years old? We\ncertainly needed them, but I suppose it would have been even more\nhumiliating to have had their help. No, tough it out alone. Ask for no\nhelp.\nThe following year, I did not go out for the football team, even\nthough it was my senior year. Let’s face it, I wasn’t very good. But, I\npreferred to be alone. I threw the shot put and discus, solitary events\nwhich leave a lot of time for thinking.\nI did not apply for enrollment in any college. I started working as a\ntruck driver the Monday after my high school graduation. I found a job\nat a Kimberly Clark paper mill. I felt an obligation to be the\nbreadwinner.\nAfter about one-half year, our money situation stabilized. My father\nreceived social security disability payments, and so did I, as his son.\nHe was awarded a disability pension. When the chance to go to school\narrived, I took it with my parent’s blessings and encouragement. I am\nsure it was a financial hardship. In the sprint from my undergraduate\ndegree to my PhD, I only took one summer off to work at a hospital. I\nfelt as though I never would get such a chance again.\nMy father was ill, sometimes very sick. His ability to walk continued\nto deteriorate. He was in and out of the hospital. Pneumonia. All sorts\nof complications of not being able to move well. The onset of diabetes\nadded to it. He required constant care, which my mother gave without a\nwhimper. We could not afford a wheelchair, so my mother would drag a rug\nwith my father on a plain kitchen chair to move him around the house. It\nwas, I am sure, exhausting.\nIn the summer of 1969, poised between the last course for my\nbaccalaureate degree and a move from Niagara Falls, New York, to Bowling\nGreen, Ohio, to start my master’s degree, I was very anxious. No one\ntold me not to go, but I felt very guilty leaving my mother and father\nalone to fend for themselves. I had done the heavy work when my father\nneeded to be lifted, moved, shaved, and the like. I was leaving my home\nfor good. What would they do? No one said a word about all this, but it\nfestered in my conscience like an ugly, infected boil.\nThen, one night in the summer of 1969, I had a vivid dream, one whose\ncolors, smells, sounds, and temperature I can sense to this day.\nIn this dream, I spoke to my parents in our kitchen and then ascended\nour stairs to a second floor that was musty because all we did was store\nold things in the two bedrooms in our little box house on the first\nfloor. Amazingly, there was another door – we did not have the third\nfloor, but there it was, a door. I walked through the door and up the\nsteps it opened to.\nAs I reached the top of the stairs, I was high above the city on a\nrectangular platform. Above was a black, coal-black, sky with a thousand\nvivid points of light. Stars, some white-hot, others red, green, and\nblue. The air was cool and comfortable.\nI turned to see my parents standing behind me, smiling in a way that\nI had not seen in many years. They seemed satisfied, happy, and\nexpectant, although they did not utter a word.\nThey led me to a corner of this open roof. There, inside a doorway,\nwas a room. A room I had not seen for many years.\nIt was the room I had when I was eight years old.\n\nIn the center of the room was my old twin bed, cheap wooden\nheadboard, and footboard painted in a pastel gloss. On the bed was a\nworn, fuzzy bedspread. Embroidered on the bedspread was a picture of Roy\nRogers and his horse, Trigger. In the embroidered script below their\nlikenesses, there was “Roy Rogers Double R Bar Ranch!” This was the\nbedspread on which for years I had bounced, assembled my toys, read my\nbooks, staring at the ceiling waiting for sleep.\nA small lamp cast a low, orange glow over the area. My dresser was to\nthe left of the bed. On the dresser was an airplane I had assembled from\na kit.\nI moved to the side of the bed to see the dresser better. My little\nblue ceramic dog cradling bits of pencils, knives, and chewing gum was\nthe corner of the dresser’s top, just as I remembered him. The little\nblue dog had been in my room really all those years, but he had receded\ninto the background under pretzel-twisted shirts, rumbled clothes, and\nthe detritus accumulated by a young person. But, here he was in my\ndream, fresh as the day I first put him to work to hold my favorite\npossessions.\nI turned 180 degrees to see my parents looking at me with simple,\nreassuring smiles. They were close, holding hands, one arm of each\nother. The look they had shown unconditional love and acceptance. A\nglimpse of happiness and anticipation was on their faces. It is shocking\nhow palpable this image seems to me as I reflect upon it now.\nMy father gestured toward to bedroom. Even though he said nothing, I\nfelt he was offering it to me. As a place of refuge, as a place of love\nand acceptance, like home.\nThe warmth of his gesture and the looks on their faces said I could\nhave this place forever, be safe and secure, and be loved. All I had to\ndo was to ask.\nI said to them, “No, thank you.”\nThey both smiled. My mother said, “Yes, we figured so.” “Now, go\nahead,” she said softly and kindly and with a smile.\nAs though dragged by a wind down a tunnel, I woke instantly. I\nsnapped upright in my bed. I was confused about my location for a bit. I\nlistened, but all I could hear was the song of tree frogs calling in the\nnight.\nIt was 4:00 am. I left my bed, walked to the front porch, and stared\nat the horizon until the sun came up.\nThe feeling was amazing. A burden was lifted from me. I realized,\nwhat I should have known already, that my parents wanted the best for my\nfuture, even if the burden lifted from me would add to their burden.\nAnd, this is the way it is. Parents sacrifice for their children. The\nchildren often never recognize what great love their parents have for\nthem and what huge sacrifices the parents make for them. Usually, the\nparents never realize the esteem with which their children hold them.\nBut gratitude is not something that factors into delivery of pure,\nunconditional love, is it?\nSo, in the end, my dream taught me that my parents wanted my success,\nnot my dependency. The dream summarized and crystallized what I knew in\nmy heart.\nMy little blue dog was there in life and in my dream. With those big\npuppy eyes, I noticed him sitting in a dark corner of my family room\nwaiting still for me. I buffed him up and brought him to my office,\nwhere he will be enshrined throughout the rest of my career.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:08:19 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n\nMy essay was published originally as “It’s a sad guess what happened\nto Big Easy’s street people.” in The Morning Call (Allentown,\nPennsylvania, newspaper), September 7, 2005, p. A11.\n\nThe air is heavy and thick. A smell of moldy wood and decaying\nvegetation competes with the oily smoke given off by clams frying and\nthe stale smell of beer dumped along the gutter.\nSweat flows over the hills and valleys of your body and soaks even\nyour socks. In fact, it almost always feels like you are in a bath. Rain\narrives almost daily, sometimes as a wild soaker, leaving puddles\neverywhere that the soon-to-follow burning sun cooks into a misty boil\nto poach, with indifference, sturdy natives, wigged transvestites, dyed\nstreetwalkers, corner musicians, blue-jeaned rednecks, bar hucksters,\nstreet barkers, and visiting farmers from Nebraska.\nThis is New Orleans.\n\nI visit New Orleans frequently. Long ago I had my fill of the city’s\ncheap, touristy side. As the years passed, however, I learned that the\ncity always offers what the locals call lagniappe, a word with\nseemingly murky French/Spanish/Creole origins that means “a little\nsomething extra.” Like when you order a pound of ground beef, and the\nbutcher adds a few ounces of beef for free just for you. Lagniappe\nbreeds good will and friendship. It makes you want to come back.\nA lesson for city gentrifiers and community developers everywhere:\nit’s people – not buildings, streets, or parking lots – who pass out the\nlagniappe. It’s not for sale. There are no tickets to lagniappe. You get\nit for free.\n\nI have discovered that New Orleans’ best distributors of lagniappe\nare its street people. Now, for sure, they panhandle. They could use a\ngood hot bath. And, they display all the healing fractures, scars,\nleathered skin, missing teeth, and torn and second-hand clothing\nassociated with hard lives on the streets. At times, they even appear a\nbit frightening. However, the street people are part of the vibrant and\ncolorful, yet largely invisible, underbelly of New Orleans culture.\nMaybe it’s the heat and humidity. Maybe it’s the South. Maybe it’s\nthe Big Easy, New Orleans, itself. But, street people in New Orleans put\non a languid look and feel far beyond what cheap alcohol and drugs could\never create. They realize that “friendly” works better than “nasty” and\nthat you might as well have fun while moving through a hard life.\nDuring one pre-Katrina trip to New Orleans I strolled during the\nearly evening down Bourbon Street. I passed the loud music bars with\nhurricane doors wide open, stopped to look at the man who will take your\npicture for $5 with his giant white parrot, and listened to the guy\nplaying the saxophone off-key, but with great verve. Just then, someone\ncalled to me with the quintessential New Orleans greeting, “Hey, baybee,\nwhere y’at?”\n\nI turned to see two people, both white, by the corner of a building.\nShe had long, somewhat gray, stringy hair, three missing teeth in front,\nand a brown, leathered face. She looked about 45, yet I found out later\nthat she was 24. He had a pale pie face, head full of curly black hair,\na scraggy beard, and pants cut off at mid-calf. He rested on a one\ncrutch. They flashed great, mischievous smiles at me.\nShe said, “Baybee, you got fiddy cents for a coffee?” I just looked\nat them for about ten seconds. The guy started to laugh, “You see? He\ndoan believe all dat tawk bout cawfee, eeder!” They both laughed. I\nmoved over to meet them.\nThey realized that I wasn’t going to give them money, so they just\nintegrated me into their street operation. We talked while they\nhustled.\n“Hey, shoog, you gotta qwawdder?” “Maybe one a dem silvah dimes?”\n“Now, looka here, I am f’sure thirsty, baybee.” “You gonna spend dat\nmoney in you pawket somewhere nasty. Bring it heeyah, boo, where I can\nkeep it for ya.”\nAll with a laugh, a smile, and a sweet, friendly disposition. Most\npeople donated nothing still walked away with a smile. And, on and on\nand on, until they gathered enough change to buy two cans of beer.\nI walked with them to a moldy, ramshackle corner store. She told me,\n“I went to Catlick school, but, f’true, baybee, I went wrong. Beer,\nbeer, beer! And, they say I got this HIV thing. I donnknow. They tell me\nI gonna be dead. Maybe I get a hawt attack r sump’in. So, let dem good\ntimes roll! I ain nevah gonna be no broad in house coat n’ curlas makin’\ngroceries over at the Schwegmanns.”\nShe turned to the clerk, “Heya, I’ll take me a Pabst Blue Ribbon, a\nDixie, and two go-cups, podna.” They both laughed.\n “Let’s go by our house,”\nshe suggested. Their “house” was a clump of thick bushes over by the\nMississippi River, which was surprisingly close to tourists walking\nalong the river. She disappeared into the thicket.\nHe told me, “Hey, cap, she gonna change, then, she wrench\n[trans — ‘to wash under running water’] her hands in the zink\nover by the Algiers ferry afta usin’ da public turlets.” She came out of\nthe bushes, where they had a bed roll, and exclaimed zestfully, “Yeah,\nyou rite!”\nI spent a lot of time with them. Yet, it surprised me that they\nremembered me every time I traveled to New Orleans, no matter how much\ntime passed between visits.\n“Hey, watchoodoon, baybee?,” she would yell when I would show up in\ntown, as though I had just returned after brief visit to the grocery\nstore. Nothing changed. I would always have extended, wonderful, and\npoetic conversations with them while I watched them ply their craft.\nThere might have been a hundred people like those two on the streets\nof New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina. Poor, but real, people whose\nlives deviated into strange, dangerous areas. But, people whose spark of\nlife made New Orleans the unique place it was.\nWhere are these people now? And, where, oh where, is New Orleans?\n\nEarly in the morning shortly post-Katrina I sat in a splendid green\npublic park in State College, Pennsylvania, my home town.1 I\nwatched a thin sliver of moon rise slowly above Mount Nittany. The back\nside of the moon glowed with reflected light from the Earth. The clear\nsky just was starting to blush with dawn’s soft light, although pimples\nof the brightest stars still showed through.\nAll was quiet except for August’s orchestra of crickets and tree\nfrogs and the slow, dim doppler whine of trucks moving along a distant\ninterstate highway. Under this same sky, in New Orleans, so far away in\nmiles and dreams from our serene Happy Valley, was birth, death, and all\nthat flows in between. I saw visions of chaos. Fear. Tears. Murder.\nBurglary. Loss.

    "contents": "\nIt is 17 degrees F outside. The wind will pick up, and the snow will\ndrift.\nRocky, some version, is on the TNT network right now, and\nRocky is kissing Adrianne for the first time. There’s the heat,\neh? But, on to snow.\nSnow. Snow is not to watch. Snow is to be in the midst of. I grew up\nin Niagara Falls, New York. Snow, in all its variations, is\nfamiliar.\nOnce, when I was about 15 years old, almost 30 inches of snow fell.\nIn the early evening, after supper, I called a girl, my buddy who lived\ndown the street, on the phone. We agreed to dress in quadruple layers,\ncomplete with scarves, several wool hats, and two or three gloves. Our\nparents thought we were crazy. We met under the street light at the end\nof the street, and we were off.\nThe storm was thick. Snow was still coming down in big, feathery\nflakes, accumulating on top of the inches already on the ground. The\nwind blew in off the Niagara River and molded the snow into long,\nundulating drifts across the field next to my house. The lights from the\never-working chemical factories – Hooker Electrochemical,\nAlox, among others – and the Kimberly Clark paper mill\nmade the large flakes of snow settling over the open field glow like\ncrystal.\nThe field of snow was untouched. It was a perfect white blanket. My\nfriend and I started out through the snow. For her, the snow seemed to\nbe waist-high. I was much taller, but still, it was tough slogging for\nme. We had agreed days before that we would run through the next heavy\nsnow just to determine what it would feel like.\nWe took off at a run. Well, a run is like running in a pool of water.\nI plowed the way; my friend followed. As we picked up speed, the\nexhilaration of the run kicked in. My friend was no jock, so she was\nwinded. As we neared the fence of the Hooker Electrochemical\nplant, the harmonics of the drifts increased. A foot of snow. Then, four\nfeet of snow! At once, we were running freely, only in the next moment\nto hit some drift like smashing into a wall of pillows.\nWe hit one immense drift, and we both fell. It was a soft tumble down\nthe side of a drift and into a trough that contained nothing but\nyellow/brown tall grass made brittle by the extreme cold. We both sat\nthere panting between two great drifts.\nI know what you are thinking, but I never thought of my friend in\nother than brother-sister terms. Her mom was like my mom. She might have\nfelt differently at some point. She did invite me to a special sophomore\nschool dance. Maybe she just needed a date. At any rate, I never had any\nspecial feelings for her. However, my girlfriend at the time was pretty\nunhappy that I accompanied my friend to the dance. But, hey, I did agree\nto go months before.\nAs we sat there, my friend said, “Your girlfriend is very\npretty.”\n“Yeh, I know.”\n“What do you like about her?” she asked.\n“Well, she is nice. She has large brown eyes and is beautiful, don’t\nyou think?”\nShe agreed.\nI said, “And she likes me, too.”\n“But, why?” my friend resting in the snow asked. It wasn’t a question\nthat was meant to tease me. It was a serious question.\nI confess I couldn’t figure out why. I didn’t answer. It was a\nmystery to me, and it still is. I knew what I felt. I couldn’t fathom\nwhat my beautiful girlfriend felt. To this day, I only know what I feel.\nI can’t imagine what others see.\nWe sat there on the ground quietly for what must have been five\nminutes. We weren’t cold yet–too many layers of clothes. Spotlights from\nthe factories broke through the air, putting the spaces between the\ndrifts into sharp contrast and, in the next instant, diffusing light\nover the surging, scudding seas of white flakes.\nIt was a Sunday night. The world used to stop on Sundays, not like\nnow when we have 24-hour news, the presence of all-night convenience\nstores, and the Internet. No, the city was quiet on Sunday nights in\n1962, and the industrial plants were, too. You could hear the wind blow\nover the drifting snow.\nSwish-like sand moving on a windswept beach told the story of the\nflakes of snow moving here and there and piling into more extraordinary\nmounds only to shift again to regroup, to combine into new mounds and\nshapes. It was difficult to believe that boys played baseball in the\nsummer on this identical spot, and people walked through these very\nreedy grasses to be frightened to death here and there by the explosion\nof a frightened pheasant. Winter created a new and different world,\nindeed.\nThen, without any discussion, we both rose and walked slowly back\nthrough our almost covered tracks over the 100 yards or so to\ncivilization. I walked my friend to her home, where we stripped off all\nbut the last layer and my friend’s mom, Mabel, made us steaming hot\ncocoa with marshmallows.\nMabel was quite a card. She always had her bobby-pinned hair in a\nwrap and wore a flowered housecoat. She looked for all the world like\nthe wife in the Andy Capp comic strip. Mabel was a Canadian citizen, and\nshe held irreverent opinions about the United States that perhaps were\nthe seeds of my first critical political thoughts.\nI carried my extra layers of clothes home in my hands. I was pretty\ntired, although it was still early night. I threw my snow- and\nice-covered clothes in the corner, where they puddled on the floor to my\nmother’s dismay, said good night to my parents, and went to my room.\nI remember looking out my bedroom window toward the factory lights on\nthe horizon. The snow still fell, and it continued throughout the night.\nNo school the next day. I distinctly remember wondering about the future\nbefore I went to bed that night. What would I be like when I was old –\nsay, 40 or 50 years old? Haha! Here I am 571\nyears old. Not much different, eh?\nSnow. It arrives, at times, light and free. Other times, heavy and\nwet. Sometimes the flakes are big and feathery. At other times, the\nword, flake, does not describe the pinpoints that drive into\nyour cheeks as you struggle to walk into the wind. Occasionally, snow is\ndelivered with a howl, almost parallel to the ground. Yet, certain snows\nwaft down calmly, riding back and forth on light breezes. Snow can melt\non warm blacktop driveways. It can stick like cotton candy to surfaces.\nIt also can pile as though dump trucks dropped it off by mistake on your\nsidewalk. Like a sweet, soft painting or like a scary roller coaster\nride. All various. Every snow was new.\nSo, this is the snow I see. The snow accumulates here in Pennsylvania\ntoday. We are not done yet. The weather people say it will continue\nthrough the evening.\nOh, by the way, the movie just ended. Rocky won the fight, of course,\nand he still loves Adrianne. She just ran into the ring and kissed that\nbig lug with the blood on his face and the sweat dripping off him. It is\na mystery, isn’t it?\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:11:40 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n |The Passmore bros: Kenneth (my father), Allen, Tom (l to r)\n\n\nEvery man’s memory is his private literature. ~Aldous Huxley\n\n\nWe do not remember days; we remember moments. ~ Cesare Pavese,\nThe Burning Brand\n\nEach of my memories has a little heat. In moments of icy sweetness or\nduring very early mornings when I am the only one stirring as silence\nblankets my room, these memories float before me, waiting to be plucked\nfrom the air and studied as a paleontologist might examine clinically a\nfossil or as one who appreciates fine art might scan brush strokes or\ncolor for insight into an artist’s process, thoughts, technique, and\nmotivations. I have a veritable museum of memories similar to Andy\nWarhol objects in his installation, Floating Plastic\nInevitable.\nThis morning, by strange coincidence, hot air balloons actually\ndrifted across Houserville, a tiny community outside of State College,\nPennsylvania, my hometown. Such is the landscape of my memories that is\ncrowded with Jackson Pollock splotches of silver, red, and gold and the\nragtag detritus of my life. After 57 years,1, a\nman can accumulate an air controller’s nightmare of memory traffic\ncontaining events, feelings, smells, and textures, some as clear as high\nmountain air and others weathered and scratched as old photographs in\nthe family history trunk. When the rest of my life is on low flame,\nthese memories ascend and move across my valley.\nSnatch one from the air. What do I see?\nKenneth, my father – oddly to many, I always affectionately called\nhim “Father,” not “Dad” – was a quiet and gentle man who grew up in\nPennsylvania and migrated to Niagara Falls, New York, to find work\nduring the Great Depression in the United States. He married my mom,\nClara, and they remained in Niagara Falls. My parents were approximately\n37 years old when I was born, making them mostly much older than my\ncontemporaries’ parents. I am their only child. They both are dead now\nand are in my thoughts often.\nMy father was the most significant person in my life, more prominent\nthan anyone else I had ever met. As an only child who was a bit sickly\nwhen young, my father was my close friend. I used to get up to eat\nbreakfast with him in the morning, wave to him as he drove out of the\ngarage at 6:50 each morning, and wait for him to come home at 5:00\npm.\nI thought he was the strongest and most fantastic man who lived, by\nwhich all others were to be judged. When he told me that he had worked\non a local bridge project when my father first came to Niagara Falls, I\nbelieved and told others that he built the bridge by himself. I imagined\nthat he ran the company he worked for.\nI thought we were rich, although, in fact, he never made over $10,000\nin any year. When he planned to vote for Eisenhower, I liked Ike. When\nhe had an opinion, I valued it above all others. If he had a fact, the\ntruth of the fact was unassailable. If he made a promise, it was as good\nas done.\nMy father worked for Autolite Battery and\nwas the personnel director in charge of all non-salaried workers. This\nposition meant that he would attend all funerals as a company\nrepresentative. We often would go directly to the home of a widow after\nshe had learned of a death. He would quietly help with arrangements and\noffer support. Unobtrusive. Effective.\nHe took me to funerals homes where workers who died would be “laid\nout.” Once, we arrived at a funeral home before anyone had shown up. No\none, not even the funeral director, was in the room. As we stood next to\nthe casket, he told me. “Go ahead, touch him.” I was horrified at the\nthought of touching a dead body. But, he said, “He is dead. He won’t\nhurt you. None of us get out of this world alive.” He held the dead\nman’s hand in his own and told me about him. I gathered my courage and\ngrabbed the deceased’s hand, too. Cold and immobile, frightening at\nfirst, and then strangely easy to hold as my father spoke calmly and\nsoftly to me about the man’s life.\nWe took chairs along the wall. People started to enter the funeral\nhome. The dead man’s wife arrived. My father walked over to her as she\nstood in front of the casket. He always kept a spare, clean handkerchief\navailable, as did most gentlemen of the day. When the widow saw my\nfather, she walked over to him and nestled her head on his chest, and\nbegan to cry. Not just tears, but the tears of a woman lost. Deep\ngrief-filled sobs. He took out his handkerchief and gave it to her. I\nwatched closely to ensure I was taking all of this instruction in. He\nspoke to her in low tones, acknowledging her grief.\nI saw this happen at least a dozen times. I absorbed every nuance –\nthe tilt of his head, the tone, and volume of his voice, the way he\nfocused on the person in front of him. My father was the one who\nunderstood, the one from whom you could receive relief, the one who\npulled it all together. I studied every move he made, and he motivated\nme to be the one that people would rely on.\nTo this day, I feel like I never reached the level of empathy he\ncould demonstrate. Where he was quiet, humble, and strong, I am, at\ntimes, filled with more blather than I should have, too self-absorbed,\nand weak in a pinch. However, there is much there that is my father.\nWhen I cough, I sound just like him. His laugh is mine. I clear my\nthroat as he did. The timbre of my voice on the first word I speak in a\nconversation is his. If my eyes are blue, they are his blue, which I\nremember as though those eyes were in front of me at this moment.\nWhen I was about seven years old, my father was in the hospital for\nabout four weeks. To be separated from my father while he was\nhospitalized was quite painful to me. Boy, did I miss him. Little boys\nunder twelve years old were not allowed in patients’ rooms under any\ncircumstances. So, a kind nurse smuggled me to my father’s room at the\nend of her shift.\nWhen I entered his room, I was afraid to come near because I didn’t\nwant to hurt a sick person, especially my father. But, of course, he\ncalled me over and gave me a big hug which, to this day, fills the\nuniverse. Then he gave me some hospital candy and words that he would be\nhome soon. It was all-sustaining.\nI often wonder if there is anything in me that my three children have\nabsorbed? Each is a good, independent thinker, and they all know their\nown minds. Of these and other traits, I am proud. I have distinct, deep,\nand personal memories of each of them.\nWhat will endure from my father’s generation and before through my\ngeneration, my children’s, and those yet to come? What aspect of me will\nthey remember after I am dust? Well, we’ll have to wait and see how the\nreview comes in. As in the Chinese proverb, “One generation plants the\ntrees; another gets the shade.”\nSometimes we are engaged in a miracle that we don’t even\nrecognize.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:12:26 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n\nI think I can have a piece of the romance novel market. Here is a\nprécis for you editors with your fat wallets filled with expansive cash\nadvances for authors with sure-shot romance novel ideas.\nCheck this one out. It is only one of the many bodice rippers I am\noutlining today.\nTitle\nThe Inverted Matrix\nMain Characters\nJohn, a tweedy, 40-something, never married economist,\nknown for laughing at inappropriate times during addresses by the dean\nof his college, who has bicycled to work every day for the 428 days,\nrain or snow, wind or calm, sun or cloud.\nMarie, a 23-year old, bespectacled mathematician, is\ndoing a thesis on “Simultaneous approximation by the linear combination\nof modified Bernstein polynomials” that is being whispered about\nadmiringly around her department.\nJohn and Marie have weathered independently the Sasser worm\non their computers without any long-term damage. Both run Linux on\neverything, including on their watches. Both refuse to use Microsoft\nanything or touch or even look toward an Apple product. They agree that\nworking on the command line is good enough to get anything of any\nsubstance done. They know their locations, their pwd, at all\ntimes and can pipe commands with competence and stamina.\nMarie programmed her turtle in the logo coding language when\nshe was 3.5 years old. One day John’s parents found him at 7 years old,\nblocks away in a public library browsing discrete math textbooks, much\nas the parents of Jesus found him teaching at the temple. Sometimes it\nseems as though non-geeks do not see their inner beauty as their mothers\ndo…but if John and Marie followed the blues masters, they would realize\nthat their moms could just be jivin’ them, too.\nReader Requirements\nIt is presumed that the reader has a background in mathematics\nthrough calculus, with a particular interest in matrix algebra, an\nunderstanding of Walrasian economic systems, including Leontief models,\na belief in rational economic theory a la Lucas, and an abiding\nappreciation for market economies.\nA Hot Excerpt….\nAfter a long colloquium filled to the brim with PowerPoint slides,\nMarie is in John’s office pouring over the matrix equations necessary to\naccount for economic output and employment. Before them is,\nX, an I-by-I matrix of dollar\ntransactions among I industries, with self-supply on the\ndiagonal element, and K, an I-by-K\nmatrix of dollar sales of industry i to GDP category\nk. John explains that total economic output , y, a\n1-by-I vector, is merely X +\nK.\nMarie points out gently that the division of all elements of\nX by y produces a matrix, A,\nof coefficients showing the proportion of y transacted among\nI industries to produce a unit of total output.\nFurthermore, she asserts more forcefully, now that she sees his\npupils dilate widely, that with the introduction of an identity matrix,\nI, and with a bit of substitution of a few terms, you\ncould create a matrix, (I - A)1, that showed the marginal increase\nin production necessary to deliver an additional unit of output to\ny.\nTo this point, seemingly devoid of any emotional life, John perks up\nand turns slowly to her. Their eyes meet. A blue-white hot heat rises\nbetween them.\nIn this moment of epiphany, John knows that his life has been empty\nand that Marie has become the flower in his life. He turns to her,\nknocking over the cup of chai that stood cold at the edge of his desk.\nTheir eyes meet. They both know this is love, although neither has\nexperienced it before unless you can comprehend mystically that studying\nspherical geometry is love unto itself and the ages.\nTheir lips meet, and so do their glasses, knocking all akimbo frames\nand the lanyards that attach the glasses around their necks. They trip\nover a stack of National Bureau of Economic Research bulletins,\nstumble over the metal clasps that tighten John’s pants to his ankles as\nhe rides his bike, and fall giddily into old, crumpled brown paper bags\nthat John uses to bring fruit into the office and fails to throw out or\nrecycle.\nThis love, now new…… –> and it can continue.\n…\nYou are thinking, Oh, Yeh!, I want more of that\nstory. But maybe with a little bit of slide rule mentioned?\nCome and get it, you New York acquisition editors with the LA lawyers\nsporting ponytails and Robert La Roche teashade sunglasses! I am\nprepared to dish more of this hip prose for the lonely and\nbroken-hearted.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:13:00 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n\nAs I am writing this (longhand, without a computer, if you can\nimagine that!), it is 11:00 on a Sunday morning on the Dingle\nPeninsula in far west Ireland. I reached the [Brandon Point}(https://www.wildatlanticwayonline.com/map-of-kerry-wild-atlantic-way/discovery-points/brandon-point/)\nafter a long ride across thin, winding County Kerry roads\nafter a high and spectacular drive on steep cliffs over the Connor Pass.1\n\nI just stepped over the stairway gate. The stairs are a farmer’s way\nof keeping the sheep in but allowing people access to the land.\n\nI am perched on a little twenty-foot crook of turf at the edge of a\ntall, steep cliff overlooking Brandon Bay. Surf pounds on the rocks\nabout 150 feet below. This is a raw, green place.\nSeveral birders are on the level ground above me with their lenses\ntrained out to the bay, where six Bottlenose Dolphins are hunting the\nunwary sea birds who sit on the surface of the calm water about\none-quarter of a mile from our site. It is a Sunday, but there is no\nrest in the animal world for a good meal.\n\nAs I mentioned, I have no computer with me, so I am writing this in\nmy dirty, scribbled scrawl, hoping for a straightforward interpretation\nand translation later. To my left – far, far away – is the United\nStates. Many Irish had its vision in their minds from this point on the\nDingle Peninsula long before they entered steerage to pass over to Ellis\nIsland, to New York City, on to a new world of America, leaving these\nfair, green shores behind forever.\n\nMy seat on this ledge is soft and sculpted by heather bushes. The\nwind is light today, and the sun is hidden by low, misty clouds. But, it\nis not cold, nor is it hot.\nSea birds soar along the cliffs and, at times, trim the tops of the\ngently rolling sea in search of delicate piscine tidbits for their\nlunch. Cliff birds now whistle to each other, perhaps to signal the\nposition of the ever-watching Peregrine Falcon that has nested on the\ncliff.\nEvery once in a while, the heather around me becomes bee-loud as it\nis harvested for pollen for nearby nests. The birders above me fix their\nlenses here and there and call out their glorious finds to each other,\nto be written down in their birding logs like love letters. Everything\nhere feeds off everything else.\n\nHow often am I away in some land distant from my home when I am\nseized by a vision captured, in turn, from one-half a world and nearly\nan entire lifetime away? Today, perhaps it was brought on by passing\nchurches with ruddy-faced people streaming from them. Maybe it was\nhearing on Irish Radio One that Ronald Reagan died. I don’t know. But,\nfor some reason, as I drove next to a field with a pretty gray horse in\nit, the little synapses fired, and I was taken back to my days as an\naltar boy at Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Niagara Falls, New York,\nmy home town.\nFunerals provided an excellent way to be both devious and devout when\nI was young. Luckily, the deceased would have the courtesy to pass over\non such a day to allow the scheduling of a funeral rite on a school day.\nNo tests, no recitations, no memorization of the times table, no\ndiagramming of compound sentences could keep the altar boy from his\nsacred duty to serve at a Catholic burial rite. The Rite of Reception,\nthe Liturgy of the Word, the Liturgy of the Eucharist, and the Final\nCommendation and Farewell required our expert services.\n\nOh, how it might have infuriated our captors – Sister Mary Modesta,\nSister May Lucina, Sister Mary Elsa, et al. – that we were excused from\nschool for a full, delicious two or more hours for a morning! Most\nmornings, we would be humiliated by being asked to recite from memory\nthose golden nuggets of Catholic doctrine encapsulated in responses to\nquestions outlined in our Baltimore Catechism. A funeral\nallowed us to tip our hats to these captors and our fellow prisoners and\nmove smoothly over to the church sacristy to prepare for the solemn task\nof poling the dead across the River Styx.\nBoys who could muster a certain gravitas were chosen to serve at the\nburial rite. No snickering. No staring. No hesitation in Latin responses\nto the priest’s incantations. No fault in ritual could be broached.\nOrnaments in the burial process, we were to be part of the tableau\nremembered by the family of the deceased.\nThe alter boys assembled and donned ill-fitting cassocks that made us\nlike frumpy junior priests. Then, we pulled over our heads great, white,\nfluffy blouses that seemed more appropriate for pregnant women. The\npriest was in black vestments. This black motif changed around the time\nof Vatican II to white to represent joy at death. In The\nHistories by Herodotus2, we read about an\nancient tribe that wept at the birth of a child because of the suffering\nit would endure in life. However, the tribe had a bang-up wang dang\ndoodle of a party when a person died because the trials of the world\nwere over for the person. Everyone seems to have a cultural ritual\naround death.\nAs the time arrived for the funeral, the bell in the church tower\nwould toll slowly and solemnly. The hearse would arrive, with the\nrelations and friends of the deceased following in separate cars. Before\nwe left the sacristy, the priest would cuff the worst lunkhead among us\non the back of the head and warn us all: “No slip-ups! Remember what you\nare doing!”\nWe would process to the church’s vestibule to meet the coffin\ncarrying the deceased’s body, followed by family and friends. The two\nmost trustworthy of the altar boys would unfold a black pall and drape\nit over the casket with the help of the undertakers.\n\nAt this point, we could size up the mourners. As they entered the\nchurch, the full weight of the death seemed to settle on the mourners.\nEyes would redden. Sometimes, the entire family clustered like a clutch\nof small, frightened puppies. At other times, children or brothers and\nsisters hung apart, as they had when the deceased was alive. The weak\nrested on the strong. The entire family dynamic sculpted itself in front\nof us.\nWe would turn and lead the procession of the draped coffin, the\nundertakers, and mourners to the front of the church. Six tall black\ncandles stood in the silent honor guard at the casket’s side as it stood\nbefore the altar. Mass would begin.\nFor most of my years as an altar boy, Mass was recited in Latin. The\nmajority of the laity could not tell what was going on without\ntranslation cards. Deeply mysterious! The non-Catholics in attendance\nwere bewildered by the standing, the sitting, the kneeling, and then\nstanding again. Why? When? Their faces showed their muted irritation at\nthis Latin, Popish ritual.\nAt times, the family would request a High Mass, which involved more\ncandles and lots of singing (in Latin, of course). More time on the\nclock for us altar boys before we went back to the Island of Punishment,\nHumiliation, and Boredom in the sovereign state of our school.\nBut what great luck if the family requested a Solemn High Mass! This\nwould involve three priests and more altar boys in a great act of\ndistributive justice. And, best yet, the Solemn High Mass lasted the\nlongest because the ritual was sung amidst pauses for waving of\nthuribles of incense all around. As a side note, I always thought that\nthe boys who served funeral Masses at the Orthodox churches had it best.\nMan, they sing everything…three times…and incensed is delivered by the\ntruckload.\nThe end of the Mass always ushered in a difficult period. The priest\nwould chant, and the choir would answer:\n\nEgo sum resurrectio et vita\nI am the Resurrection and the Life.\n\n\nqui credit in me etiam si mortuus fuerit,\nvivet et omnis qui vivit\nHe that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live,\n\n\net omnis qui vivit, et credit in me, non\nmorietur in aeternum.\nand every one that lives, and believes in me, shall never die.|\n\nThese were profound, solemn words, intoned during a sad, slow march.\nThis march signified for the family that the internment was near and a\nmove closer to the cemetery would occur. Tears would flow. Sobs would\noften be heard. The undertakers would move forward to turn the coffin so\nthat the deceased left the church head first.\nThe undertakers. A distinct lot, as I began to learn after serving at\nmany a funeral. In Niagara Falls, an ethnic town, an undertaking service\nwas available for every ethnic group. For instance, the Tubinis Funeral\nHome and the Zajac Funeral Home served the Slavic population. The Rooney\nFuneral Home seemed to be favored by the Irish. The Williams Funeral\nChapel served only Black families. The Maggadino Memorial Chapel was for\nItalians. Of course, lines were crossed, but not often.\nThe Maggadino Memorial Chapel seemed to me to be the most\ninteresting. It was owned by Stefano Maggadino, a reputed Mafia boss\nwho, it is said, figured in the John F. Kennedy assassination in his own\nlittle way.\n\nRumor was that the Maggadino Memorial Chapel had a secret level below\nthe funeral home from which the Maggadino crime empire was run. Hints\nwere whispered of burials of murder victims double-stacked with\nsomebody’s grandma. Few know – and, as they say, the rest aren’t talkin’\n– whether this was true. However, these dark stories fueled the\nimagination on long, dark, cold nights as I walked from the city\nlibrary, passing the Maggadino Memorial Chapel on my way home.\nThere was no doubt, though, that undertakers from the Maggadino\nMemorial Chapel were the real deal among the altar boys. Man, they\nlooked like wise\nguys! Dark. Secret. Mustachioed. Fit and tailored well into dark\nsuits–pinstripes, in fact. Dark glasses topped it off. They never\nsecretly smiled or winked at us as the other friendly funeral directors\ndid. Hard.\nI frequently saw at services the same undertakers from the Maggadino\nMemorial Chapel. You could never figure out what was going on in the\nbrains behind those deep black shades. Seriousness? Agita?\nMeditation?\n\nAt the point that arrived in one funeral service when the body was to\nbe turned to leave the church head first, nothing happened. The priest\nwaited for several uncomfortable beats for the undertakers to turn the\nbody. Nothing happened. I subtly raised my chin a little bit in the\ndirection of one of the Maggadino guys. You could see he was startled\nout of whatever reverie he had fallen into. He moved promptly in a kind\nof twitch that was atypical of the cool, smooth movements that went\nalong with being a goomba. The casket was turned. All moved\nforward without a hitch from that point.\nI was outside my school during the lunch period the day after the\nfuneral. A black car drew up to the curb. With shades still on and a\ncigarette dangling from his mouth, the undertaker stepped out of his car\n– and he started walking toward me! Was this the end? Had I\ncrossed his macho line by nudging him to move the casket? I developed a\nkind of rigor mortis that I am sure he had seen that very day\nin one of his “clients.”\nHe walked up to me, pulled out a wad of cash wrapped with a gum band,\npeeled away a $10 bill, and handed it to me. He leaned forward to say,\n“Hey, you’re a good kid.” And, then, those ever-horizontal, razor-thin\nlips curved into a sort of smile. Instant cool spread over me. Rather\nthan being ball batted by this guy, we were paesano at that\nmoment. I had saved him from professional embarrassment. I expected to\nhear something like, “Someday – and that day may\nnever come – I’ll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that\nday….”. Nope, he got back into his car and drove away.\n\nBut I digress.\nAs we headed the procession out of the church, the priest would say\nsoftly to the coffin as he sprinkled it with ashes, “Memento, homo, quia\npulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris,” that is, “Remember, man, that\nthou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return.” Sobs often would become\nfull, heavy tears and loud cries, giving us young altar boys a complete\nsample of human grief to ponder and weigh like budding little scientists\nof the soul.\nWe parted company with the corpse at the door of the church. We were\nnot allowed to go along to the cemetery because this would part us from\nour studies for even more time. We didn’t really care to go anyhow\nbecause absence would have cut into our bologna sandwich, chocolate\ncake, and milk time, and we would miss several games of Red Rover. Nope, by\nthis time, we were eager to return.\n\nComing back to class in the afternoon wasn’t too bad. After all, we\nhad missed one-half of the school day! And, we were absent for a reason\nfor which our nun-wardens could not find a reason to beat us on the\nknuckles with their meter-long, metal-tipped rulers. Service is such an\nhonor, after all.\nA Peregrine Falcon just killed a small sea bird to my left. Dinner\nfor him. A funeral, perhaps for the little bird’s family? I wonder if,\nin bird society, some young birds will get a chance to loaf at a bird\nfuneral.\n\nNow, I am off from this sacred place on Brandon Point on this Sunday\nto my next destination, Castlegregory in\nCounty Kerry on the Dingle\nPeninsula.\nI say, Ite, missa est. And, you respond, Deo\ngratias.\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:13:30 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\nWhen I travel within the United States for short periods, I try to\nkeep my home time. For instance, Denver is two time zones away from my\nhometown. If I awaken typically at 5:00 am in my hometown, I make sure\nthat I wake up at 3:00 am in Denver. This practice keeps my body clock\nset so that everything stays copacetic.\nIn mid-April 1995, I traveled to San Francisco for a professional\nconference. To maintain my eastern U.S. time zone body schedule, I\ndecided to wake at 2:00 am. Sounds crazy, but it worked. I woke\nnaturally and refreshed before my alarm sounded each day while in\nCalifornia for this conference.\nAcross the street from my hotel in San Francisco stood an all-night\ndeli. Coffee! At about 3:00 am for every day of my visit, I would walk\nover and wait in line with the pimps, hookers, crack pipe artists, and\nthe all-night homeless roamers for a cup of pretty good French Roast,\nwalk back to my hotel room, and begin to do some work. Then, a thin gray\nlight would appear, and, soon, rosy-fingered Dawn, the child of the\nmorning and the sister of the Sun and Moon, would stretch over the San\nFrancisco streets. The day-livers began to stir and fill the streets.\nAnd, so, to a whole city as stately and plump Buck Mulligan said,\nIntroibo ad altare Dei.\n\nOne ritual that I follow when I visit San Francisco is walking across\nthe Golden Gate Bridge early in the morning from wherever I am located\nin the city. At times, this is a long walk, and I will start before the\nsun rises. However, I stayed at a hotel near Fisherman’s Wharf during my\nApril 1995 visit, so I had a mere few miles of a brisk walk along the\nshores of the San Francisco bay until I reached the entrance to the\nfootpath across the Golden Gate Bridge. A walk across the Bridge is a\ngreat sensual experience.\nI always stroll across the bridge, taking the time to take in the\never-new wonders of the view of the Bay area it offers. I have walked in\nthe pelting rain. I have walked in the bone-chilling wind. I have walked\nwhen a great San Francisco fog enveloped the bridge and me in isolation.\nI have walked when the signature fog of San Francisco undulated slowly\nunder the bridge, appearing as a soft, billowing linen sheet newly\ngraced by the orange sun insinuating itself through a morning\nwindow.\nAnd, I always walk across the Bridge to the artsy little town of\nSausilito, at which I visit my favorite garden restaurant for a\nwell-deserved feast consisting of a three-egg oyster and onion omelet,\nsourdough bread toast, and flagons of dark, hot coffee to ward off some\nof the meaner spirits of the weather that had gathered on the bridge to\nattempt, without success, to defeat me. Then, it’s a fast reach back\nover the Bay on the jet ferry to Fisherman’s Wharf to complete the\nritual. Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.\nOn 19 April 1995, while sitting in my hotel room, I watched a morning\nnews program on my television while the morning sun was casting long\nearly shadows on those San Francisco streets. A news flash appeared: “A\nbomb ripped through the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building at 9:02 a.m.”\nTimothy McVeigh, who was later convicted and executed after being found\nguilty of murder, was arrested 90 minutes after the bombing on a\nfirearms charge after a routine traffic stop near Billings, Oklahoma.\nBut, if I have my figures correct, 168 people died in this bombing. The\nimages flitting across the screen that morning were horrific. Little did\nwe know what more enormous catastrophe awaited us on 11 September\n2001.\nAfter watching hours of this devastation in Oklahoma City, I was a\nbit numb. I decided to get out and walk. And, walk, I did, all the way\nacross town to the City Lights Bookstore, co-founded by poet/painter\nLawrence Ferlinghetti and is a landmark independent bookstore and\npublisher that specializes in world literature, the arts, and\nprogressive politics.\n\nFinally designated a city landmark in 2001, the hangout of Beat-era\nwriters – Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among them– remains a\nvital part of San Francisco’s literary scene. This is where Allen\nGinsberg (1926-1997) first read Howl, a poem that led to\nobscenity charges. It begins:\n\nI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving\nhysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn\nlooking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient\nheavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who\npoverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the\nsupernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of\ncities contemplating jazz…\n\nI entered City Lights and found myself drawn quickly to an upper\nroom, the Poetry Room. Although the room is not huge and the stock is\nlimited, it contains some of the best poetry volumes in print on its\nshelves.\nI heard a rustle, and I turned. In a simple office off the Poetry\nRoom, at a simple wooden desk, paging through what looked to be\ninvoices, was Lawrence Ferlinghetti himself. I thought I should pay some\nhomage to the man. Maybe I have a chance to shake his hand and share a\nword.\n\nJust then, a loud clump echoed from the stairs. A short,\nbespectacled, bushy-haired man entered. He strode confidently to\nLawrence Ferlinghetti’s office door and introduced himself.\n“I am Professor blahdiddyblahblah [I didn’t get it] from\nPrinceton University. You probably know my work,” he announced.\nGraciously, Ferlinghetti rose and greeted him with a warm handshake,\nalthough it seemed visible he had no clue who this puff of hot wind\nrushing up to him was. Ferlinghetti fielded the man’s questions (“So,\nwhat is it you are working on now?” “Do you know James\nchachacha [again, I didn’t get it]? Of course, he is a close\nfriend of mine.”) without any noticeable discomfort. And, in just a\nminute, it was over. Then, the little professorial gnome of the liberal\narts was gone, and all was quiet again in the Poetry Room.\nAfter seeing that display, I could not bring myself to have the\naudacity to bother Ferlinghetti. So, I settled in a chair and looked for\na copy of Tennyson’s poems. Now, I like Tennyson, even if he rhymes, and\neven though I was classified as a “bit gauche” at a Christmas party by\nan Australian playwright for having expressed this, apparently,\npolitically incorrect and naive assessment. But, like my dog, who has\ninstincts to wag her tail when she sees food or to bark and growl when\nshe senses a threat, I just react to what I see, feel, and hear. And, I\nlike what pleases me. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima\nculpa.\nI looked to my left, where a wooden double-hung window looked from\nthe second story over an enclosed small courtyard. The sun was brilliant\nat noon. The window framed a clothesline strung at about a 35-degree\nangle ascending from left to right. On the clothesline were flapping\nwhite sheets that cast their shadows on the far courtyard wall, perhaps\nhung to dry by a maid at the small establishment next door. It was a\nscene so bright that it hurt the eyes to watch, but a tableau so\nstriking that you might be left with the feeling that it was composed\npurposefully for an artist to capture in an afternoon on a canvas with\npaints and brushes.\nI started from my reverie at the sense of a presence in the room. I\nlooked back to my right, letting my eyes adjust to the room light. It\nwas Ferlinghetti. He held a white teacup. You could see through the\nclear rose liquid to the bottom of the cup. He said simply, “For you,\nwhile you read,” to which I nodded in appreciation but added no voice to\nmy reply. Zen enough.\nI walked out of the City Lights Bookstore, across “Jack Kerouac\nStreet,” to a bar for a pint of Guinness. I can’t remember the bar’s\nname, but it was obviously a homage to the Beat Poets. A bit tacky on\nthat account, but grimy and dark-wooded enough to do the job. An\nincredible jukebox. The music poured out from the Mills Brothers to Van\nMorrison to the Rolling Stones to Frank Sinatra to Chopin’s Etude in\nC-Sharp Minor, Op 10, No 4. I read a local paper, then a bit of a novel,\nand left for the long walk back to my hotel.\nIt was now mid-afternoon, and the sun was beginning to make its slow\njourney to its nightly bath in the Pacific. I had a little less spring\nin my step during the afternoon than in the morning, partly due to the\nlong march I had taken, maybe a bit to the beer, and in no small part\ndue to having the time to reflect on the Oklahoma City disaster.\nI came to a small park where there was a wedding party of perhaps 50\npeople. I felt that the wedding had just occurred in the park because\npeople were standing around kissing the bride and congratulating the\ngroom. I stood and watched. A few of the guests spoke to me, and then\nthe bride and groom came over to say hello to me, perhaps intrigued by\nsharing their joy with a complete stranger. I wished them well.\nWhen the Greeks gods sent their earthly charges out on a mission of\nsome import, they plumped and shined them up, oiled their hair, bronzed\ntheir skin, toned their muscles, and added a discernible aura. And, so\nit was with this young couple, beautiful at the start of their journey,\neyes wide and welcoming, without a hint of care or danger. Then, after a\nbit of chatter around the group, someone began singing. Soft at first,\nthen gathering voices, it became music carried on the sweet, warm spring\nair. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound/that saved a poor wretch\nlike me/I once was lost, but now I am found/I was blind, but now, I\nsee. They stepped into their cars and left for a reception.\nI walked and walked. Passing all sorts of children and adults, dogs,\nskittering squirrels in procreative dance in the park, seagulls raiding\nthe trash cans. At last, I ended up near Fisherman’s Wharf again.\nDrumming was heard in the distance.\nI moved along the water, passed the more touristy areas of the Wharf,\npassed the turnaround for one of the runs of San Francisco’s famous\ncable cars, to a small cement amphitheater that overlooked the Bay.\nDrummers. Everywhere. Drumming.\nBig drums. Congas. Snare drums. They were beating out an infectious,\ndriving, multi-layered rhythm. They were old, young, short, tall, male,\nfemale, and in-between. There was what appeared to be a transvestite\nslamming a bass drum. An old, old man in jamaica pants, rubber flip-flop\nsandals, no shirt, and a straw hat was wailing away on a Fisher-Price\nred, white, and blue toy xylophone, drowned out by the rest of the din\nbut seemingly highly appreciated for his effort and panache by the other\ndrummers. They were swaying and sweating in a kind of ecstasy probably\nduplicated only in Congo Square in New Orleans on steamy August\nnights.\nMy eyes were drawn to some activity down by the water. Sea birds\nseemed to be thrashing about. I left the drummers and walked closer to\nwhat appeared to be a skirmish. Two seagulls were pecking wildly at\nanother bloodied and torn seagull. I watched for a minute while the two\nkilled the battered bird. They nibbled the dead bird’s flesh in a mad\ncannibalistic frenzy.\nIt seems as though this was destined to be a day for species to eat\ntheir own kind.\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:16:04 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

Maybe I am\nrunning into fewer generous spirits than I have in the past. Perhaps you\nmust be one to see one. I don’t know.\nGeorge Pinkerton worked with my father in Niagara Falls at the\nAutolite Battery factory as an office clerk. George had no hair on the\ntop of his head, but he had a ring of black hair from one ear, around\nthe back of his head, and onto the other ear, making him look as though\nhe had a monk’s tonsure.\nGeorge wasn’t called George. He was known as “Pinky.” Not as\ndegrading and diminutive as it first sounds. It was a name of affection\nassigned to a friendly man. You see, Pinky was short, maybe 5’6”. He was\nno stranger to good food. His face was round to match the rest of him.\nOften, plunked in the mouth was a fine large cigar.\nPinky had no chin. Not that he had rolls of fat around his neck.\nThere was just no chin. The flesh dropped straight from the tip of his\nmandible to his chest. He had a warm smile and sparkling blue eyes. The\neyes smiled with the face, and the total effect when you came upon him\nwas one of a friend well met.\nPinky never forgot me on my birthday, at Christmas time, at Easter,\nor on any significant events, like my first communion or confirmation,\nin my young life. I think I have a little pink elephant in a musty box\non the lower level of my house that Pinky gave me. He was the manager of\nthe factory baseball team. He always seemed like an organizer, a doer,\nsomeone you could rely on.\nPinky eventually quit the factory when manufacturing employment took\na dive in Niagara Falls. He opened a small store called Pinky’s\nCorner. Such a full-service little store does not, I believe, exist\nanymore in the United States. He had bread, milk, canned goods, beer,\nand all. But, he also had a meat counter, in front of which there were\nwood chips on the floor.\nI found out later that Pinky’s wife was an alcoholic, as was his son.\nPinky eventually remarried. He was one of the few people my father knew\nfrom his 38 years of work for Autolite Battery who called periodically\nto inquire about my father when he became disabled.\nWe lived in Iowa (getting ready to move to Pennsylvania) when my\nfather died. The expense was so great that I was the only member of my\nIowa family to be able to travel back to Niagara Falls for the funeral.\nSure enough, during the first night of the wake, Pinky and his wife\nappeared, bringing much warmth to the room. They insisted that they take\nmy mother and me out to dinner a few days after the funeral. We\naccepted.\nPinky and his wife took my mom and me to Fortunas, an Italian\nrestaurant in a Niagara Falls neighborhood. Places like Fortunas still\nexist in Niagara Falls. Small, family-owned, with great pride in the\nquality of food prepared for a reasonable price.\n\nWhat a warm time we had. Lots of memories. Pinky and his wife were\ngood listeners, so they let us babble about our lives and my father.\nThey knew that it was essential to let us talk about these things.\nThen, Pinky’s new wife told us something that startled me: Pinky’s\nex-wife lived with them until she died. She explained that Pinky’s\nex-wife’s alcoholism had grown especially severe, and her personality\nhad become so intensely virulent that she had no social network at all.\nThen, with malignant cancer, she was on her own. They took her in\nbecause she needed help. They took her in, knowing that she would be a\nreal hand full. They took her in, even though she had no money. This\nstruck me as incredibly generous.\nGenerosity was what Pinky was about. Perhaps one of the most\nimportant lessons I learned was from Pinky and my father during our\nSunday outings. Our family would go to church. Then, Pinky and my father\nlet me tag along when they visited sick and poor old men. Then, after\nbuying and eating dream-filled sugar donuts, Pinky, my father, and I\nwould go bowling at the Bowl-O-Drome on Pine Avenue in Niagara\nFalls.\n\nWhen I write “sick and poor old men,” I mean the most godforsaken\nwretches just one step up from sleeping on the street. This was not an\nera of rest homes, personal care facilities, and the like. No, there was\nnot the variety of care for older people that is available now. Instead,\nthese men lived in various houses, most of which had converted their\nthird floors into wards of sorts of three to six beds. The beds were\nthese old metal-framed beds that looked to me as though they had seen\nservice during the civil war (many of the men looked old enough to me to\nhave served, too). The house owners received the pensions of the men\nthey took in.\n\nMy father and Pinky would bring these men cigarettes and small talk.\nNone of these visits were religious because people were offered\nreligious tracts, icons, or speeches. But, they were holy because you\ncould feel the spirit that surrounded the visit.\nI must say that these visits were not easy for me as an\neight-year-old. The old men often were covered with bedsores. They\nneeded a shave and a bath. And the smell of urine and worse was very\nstrong, almost overpowering for a young nose. Worse yet, for me, was\nthat these frail, bedridden, rheumy-eyed men talked to me. “Well, hello,\nyoung man. What’s your name? Do you go to school?” I answered in quiet,\nsmall, terse sentences, barely looking into their eyes, never able to\nonce see that they once may have had a child such as me or even that\nthey might be remembering that they were once small, frail, and innocent\nas I was.\nMy father and Pinky told me that most of the men were veterans and\nthat they had come upon hard times. I remember that we walked into one\nroom to find an almost unconscious man lying in his own urine and filth.\nMy father called the homeowner, a gray-haired woman in a house dress,\ninto the room and asked her why this man was in this condition. She\nreplied, “What can I do? You clean him up, and he gets the place a mess\nagain.” My father said that the man looked like he had been in filth for\na long time, perhaps since the day before. The owner said, “I just don’t\nhave the time.”\n\nMy father and Pinky asked her for a change of bedding and bedclothes.\nPinky rounded up a basin, a washcloth, soap, and a towel. My father drew\nsome drinking water. I recognize now that this man probably was\ndehydrated. The smell was horrible, and the sight was dreadful.\nI sat on a chair in the room while my father and Pinky stripped the\nman and the bed. They re-made the bed and washed him. Then, Pinky took a\nstraight razor and shaved him. They combed his hair. I think the wash\nand shave and the water did wonders for this man because he started\ntalking to us. I don’t know to whom he would be presented in this\nsmelly, hell-hole on the third floor of an old house on 19th street in\nNiagara Falls, but he was presentable when it was all over. This act of\nkindness and service made a deep impression on me. How could Pinky and\nmy father do something so personal for this man in a way that required\nthem to ignore his wretchedness and to carefully avoid showing their\ndisgust at the plain horror of this man’s person and his situation?\nAfter giving the man his carton of cigarettes (probably one of the\nfew pleasures left for this man), my father, Pinky, and I said goodbye,\nand Pinky promised that we would be back next week. Then, we went to see\nthe hag who ran the place.\nI stood holding my father’s hand while Pinky told her in a kind voice\nthat the man in the room had served his country, that his bed was to be\nkept clean, that he was to be kept clean and shaved, and that he should\nhave water available by the bed. She replied, “I run this place, and\nI’ll work it the way I want.” My father said calmly, “We will be back\nnext week. You receive money from these men. We will report you if we\nsee these men in the same condition.” Calm, direct, straightforward,\nbelievable.\nThe following week we did return, and things were better. However, I\nam sure that my father and Pinky were pushing the rock of Sisyphus here.\nWe went out most of the time, got our donuts, bowled our game, and never\ntalked about what had happened. It wasn’t lost on me, though. I never\nforgot their generosity with this man and the others they ran\nacross.\n\nSo, the day’s coffee is Orange Seville drawn into a 16-ounce\npaper/plastic cup at Wegmans Wireless Internet Cafe, held up to the\nmorning light, and drunk in perhaps the only salute Pinky and my father\nhave had in quite a while, if at all. Possibly their equals are\ncommitting acts of corporal mercy right now. However, I don’t see them.\nAnd, in the sum of my life, I never have equaled Pinky and my father’s\ngenerosity with that one man. It is a very humbling realization.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:14:42 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Great Gorge of Niagara, a postcard\n\n\n\nOver a low stone wall across the road is the Great Gorge of Niagara.\nI am sitting in a breakfast cafe of a Canadian hotel about one mile\ndownstream from the Falls of Niagara. Both great waterfalls, the\nHorseshoe Falls and the American Falls, are on duty, even before a\nsignificant Western secular and worldwide spiritual holiday like\nChristmas day.\nFor ages, the water flowed and fell, slowly carving an abyss through\nthe Lockport Dolomite stone formation predominant in the region. This\nflow has stepped the brink of the waterfalls backward over the equally\nvast chasm of time of far greater depth of space and length of time than\nis pictured in the cheap trinket shops, tourist traps, and manufactured\n“great views” that now populate its shores and exploit its beauty.\nYes, the Niagara River rolls and boils on. Geologists tell us that\nthe Falls of Niagara eventually will become the Falls of Buffalo (20\nmiles upstream) as the river cuts its way, inch by inch, between Lake\nErie and Lake Ontario, two of the so-called Great Lakes in the United\nStates of America. I will become less than dust in the fullness of time,\nswept up and diffused about the world to land into hamlets in Austria\nand wells in China and, without rest, whisked around by the sharp,\nunrelenting winds of Patagonia. I will become someone else’s grit and\ngrime. But, the Falls will continue relentlessly and without regard for\nthe dust of me and of the millions who have stared at it in awe and\ncaptured its dynamic image on tiny Kodak Brownie cameras.\nThe Great Gorge across the road is less than a quarter-mile wide and\nis perhaps, 300 feet deep. The Gorge is more than a physical separation\nbetween two pieces of land. Sure, it politically separates Canada and\nthe United States of America. Also, it separates two cultures, Canadian\nand American, which deceive us by seeming similar.\nCanada and the United States share television, radio, news, products,\nand production. Each country’s money is discounted and exchanged daily\nacross each other’s borders. Then, of course, there is ice hockey, which\nknows no boundaries, does it? And, the two countries’ peoples are\nfriends – most of the time, in spite of our use of the word “napkin”\nwhile they use instead “serviette.” Yet, the subtle differences in\nsocialization, temperament, values, and, if it is possible to use such a\nhefty word, culture between the two countries are easy to miss. One hint\nis in the difference in the sound of spoken language.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A giant whirlpool downstream from the Falls\n\n\n\nI listen as I eat breakfast this morning. A Canadian voice is as\ndistinguishable to me anywhere. The slightly Scottish, slightly formal\nspeech and the inclusion of “eh?” at the end of many sentences are as\nidentifiable to me as the nasal, long vowels so common just one-quarter\nof a mile across the Gorge (to get a feel for this western New York\npronunciation, say the word, “aunt,” while making your mouth wide like a\nsmile that shows all of your teeth and try it with such words as\n“Alice,” “Niagara,” and “eight.”).\nI grew up across the border in Niagara Falls, New York. If a few new\nbuildings were torn down, I probably could see the hospital of my birth,\nSt. Mary’s Hospital on 6th Street, across the river through the morning\nfog and through the mists drifting from the thundering Falls just a\nshort distance to the south of its birthing rooms.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Now-demolished St Marys Hospital, 6th Steet, Niagara\nFalls, New York\n\n\n\nNiagara Falls holds a prominent spot in the history of industry,\nfinances, and innovation in the United States. It was the first place\nthat alternating current electricity was transmitted over a distance (it\nlit the street lights of Black Rock, a tiny community outside of Buffalo\nabout 15 miles to the south). It was and is the home of many\npetrochemical industries that rely on cheap electrical power to separate\nconstituent chemicals and huge electrical furnaces that use high heat\nfrom electrical arcs to smelt titanium and fuse industrial carbides.\nBecause it has become a mecca for tourists (“the honeymoon capital of\nthe world”), Niagara Falls is a sales spot for every cheap bauble and\nflashy bit of apparel that could be manufactured in the sweatshops of\nthe developing world. The cheapo, plastic Native American drums, Native\nAmerican hatchets, Native American peace pipes, and Native American\nheaddresses. There are key chains and bottle openers in Day-Glo colors.\nIf these pieces do not satiate your primary tourist’s need to acquire\nmemories, then bins are available of over-sized pencils adorned with\ntassels, wooden as well as plastic back scratchers, tiny 3” x 5” pine\nhouses (a decal says “Niagara Falls” in arcing letters) designed to hold\nburning cones of pine incense in their chimneys, clear plastic\ncontainers which, when shaken, create a shower of snow falling over the\nFalls or over the downtown Niagara skyline, and, of course, shirts,\nsweatshirts, and sweaters that have silk-screened messages proclaiming\n“My grandma went to Niagara Falls and only bought me this crummy\nt-shirt,” “What are you looking at?,” “I’m with him –>,” “UP YOURS,”\n“I’ve worked years to get this beer belly,” “Kiss Me, I’m Irish!,”\n“Whiskey is a food group, and I need to eat,” and “Foxy.”\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Honky-Tonk Niagara Falls\n\n\n\nBut, tons and tons of green-cast, bubbling water per minute continue\nto surge over the Falls, oblivious to this tacky impedimenta, just as\nthey were unknown to and never imagined by hunters in mocassins and\nbearskins carrying bows, arrows, and spears many, many years ago and to\nthe great wars fought by the French, the British, the Indians, and the\nEuropean settlers not so long ago on the plains of western New York,\nsouthern Ontario, and in the Great Gorge itself.\nThe Japanese have a word for what Niagara Falls means to me:\nba. To the best of my understanding, ba is translated\nloosely as “place.” It is a fine, short word that, when spoken, starts\nwith a pop of the lips and ends with a puff. Ba denotes not\nonly a physical space but also a specific time and space nexus.\nHeidegger once expressed a similar concept about the kind of\nlocationality that simultaneously includes space and time. A personal\nba must be experienced, which leads to transcendence beyond\none’s own limited perspectives and boundaries.\nTo those who never have seen or experienced Niagara Falls, I will\ntell you that I have stood many times at the base of the American Falls,\ndown where water pounds on rock forever, where your vision is engulfed\nby the enormity and speed of the cascade, and where the air is, at once,\n10 degrees cooler than on the plains above the Falls from which the\nwater tumbles over. Fine particles of water – a great, enveloping mist –\nare all around. No paid admission is required for this wild,\nSurroundSound show of Nature.\nYou actually can perceive the smell of the wet around you in the\ngrand sensual mix of refracted light, droplets of water, and swirling\nair filled with the detritus of the great cities along the Great Lakes\nof the United States and the headwaters and eventual tributaries that\nsupply them. A smell of ozone is in the air as water molecules are\npummeled as they hit the weathered rocks at the bottom of the steep\ncliff that forms the Falls of Niagara.\nTo perceive Niagara Falls this way is to perceive America in a\nfleeting instant. Not the land of McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, but the very\nessence of America that is mixed, matched, heated, and forged over\ncenturies of early and modern life of humans, animals, and vegetation,\nthen pounded and washed on the rocks below the Falls, and, for just one\nmoment, released by Nature for your primitive education and wonder.\nMy coffee today is a lukewarm tea-colored swill, served in a\nStyrofoam cup, without any decoration, much like the weather outside\ntoday, the day before Christmas in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada,\nacross from my hometown, Niagara Falls, New York, USA.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Google Map of Niagara Region\n\n\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-06-23 16:47:43 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\nIn the short feature movie, “Gents Without Cents,” made in 1944, the\nThree Stooges —- Curly, Larry, and Moe —- are out-of-work vaudeville\nactors who marry three dancing girls and honeymoon in, of course,\nNiagara Falls.\nAt one point, Curly mentions Niagara Falls. Moe, acting out some\npost-hypnotic suggestion, responds with the line, “Slowly I turned, step\nby step, inch by inch…I took my revenge.” Click to view the Stooges\nin “Gents Without Cents:”\n]\nThis trademark Three Stooges’ line draws guffaws from fans\neverywhere. Much to the puzzlement of younger folks, otherwise serious\nand substantial adult men and women still recite this line whenever they\nhear the trigger phrase, “Niagara Falls.” Don’t ask me why. As Jay Leno\nonce said, “Half the world loves the Stooges, and the other half wonders\nwhy.”\nThe “Slowly I turned…” line often appeared in skits on the vaudeville\ncircuit. The line was performed in Bud Abbott and Lou Costello stage\nacts. It even surfaced in an episode of the “I Love Lucy” television\nshow. Vaudeville might be dead, but Niagara Falls still delivers great\nabsurdist farce regularly.\n\nLast week1, for instance, a Michigan man\nclimbed over a wrought-iron barricade above the Horseshoe Falls on the\nCanadian side of the Niagara River, stepped into the water, and was\nswept over the Falls. Bystanders reported that he went over the 167-foot\nprecipice with his hands clasped behind his head and a smile on his\nface.\nAmazingly, the Michigan man lived, the second person known to survive\na plunge over the Falls (The other was a seven-year-old boy in a bathing\nsuit and a life vest). However, he took home some great souvenirs\nconsisting of a few sore ribs, a hunk of moss that he grabbed as he\nscrambled to land, and a criminal record in a Canadian court “for\nmischief and for unlawfully performing a stunt.” Who says Canada is not\nfun?\nThe Michigan man is the latest in a long line of Falls hoppers.\nPerhaps you know Niagara Falls as the “honeymoon capital of the world,”\na distinction that the attraction grabbed in the early 1800s after\nrelatives of Napoleon Bonaparte and the daughter of U.S. Vice President\nAaron Burr both spent their honeymoons at hotels near the Falls.\nHowever, one of the least publicized facts about Niagara Falls is\nthat each year about 40 people commit suicide by pitching themselves\nover the cascades of Niagara. In fact, Niagara Falls also is the\n“suicide capital of the world,” with an estimated 5,000 tragic deaths\nsince 1850. The only near-rivals are the Clifton suspension bridge near\nBristol in the United Kingdom and San Francisco’s Golden Gate bridge,\neach with about 1,000 suicides since 1864 and 1937, respectively. A\n\nA letter to the editor of the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation (1971;215(5):797-798. doi:10.1001/jama.1971.03180180071024) reported that:\n\nSystematic records of suicides and suicide attempts have been kept by\nthe Niagara Frontier State Parkway Police in Niagara Falls, NY, for some\nyears. The records were examined for the period 1958 to 1967. In this\nperiod an average of 5.7 attempts took place each year (range, 0 to 13)\nand an average of 7.1 successful suicides (range, three to ten). Of the\n71 suicides completed bodies were recovered for all but 15. These 15\ncases in which no body was recovered were mainly of persons observed\ngoing over the falls, or for whom evidence pointed to a possible death\nfrom having gone over.\n\nAh, but you ask, what about the daredevils and the spectacles\nassociated with Niagara Falls?\nNiagara Falls has to be one of the most theatrical settings in the\nworld. In the 1850s and 60s, Jean-Francois Gravelet, known as “The Great\nBlondin,” crossed the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope numerous times. On\nseparate occasions, he crossed it on a bicycle, blindfolded, while\npushing a wheelbarrow, with his hands and feet manacled and with his\nmanager on his back. On one occasion, he even stopped midway to cook an\nomelet on a portable grill.2\n\n\nIn 1827 as a publicity stunt, local hotel owners sent a condemned\nlake schooner, “The Michigan,” over the Horseshoe Falls with a dozen or\nso wild animals placed on board before an estimated crowd of 15,000\npeople. The animals placed on board the doomed ship included a buffalo,\ntwo small bears, two raccoons, a dog, and a goose. The schooner was\ndecorated to look like a pirate ship, with dummies of humans tied to the\ndeck to further add to the stunt.\nAs The Michigan reached the rough rapids above the Falls, its hull\nwas torn open and began filling with water. The two bears running loose\non deck jumped free into the rapids and swam to the shore. Other animals\ncaged or tied to the ship died when the schooner went over the Horseshoe\nFalls. Only the goose survived the plunge.\n\nThen, some went over the Falls in barrels or contraptions assembled\nfrom rubber, fishnet, canvas webbing, sheet metal, inner tubes, tarp, or\nsteel, which were not always seaworthy. Until our intrepid Michigan man,\nten people actually made it over alive. Two of them are women. Bobby\nLeach was one who over the Falls, but he died fifteen years later in New\nZealand due to an infection from a wound incurred from slipping on an\norange peel. Sadly, though, five daredevils died in their attempts.\n\nTwo who died accumulating the most style points while trying have to\nbe Jessie Sharp and Robert Overacker. Sharp thought he could make it\nover safely in 1990 if only he paddled his kayak hard enough. His body\nnever was found.\n\nOveracker’s endeavor proves how vital planning is. He made his\nattempt in 1995 on a speeding jet ski. He deployed a rocket-powered\nparachute just as his jet ski hit the Falls’ brink to propel himself out\nto the middle of the river away from the pounding water and sharp rocks\nbelow. The rocket worked, and the parachute opened gracefully over the\nmiddle of the river. Unfortunately, Overacker forgot to attach the\nparachute to his back. Rescuers eventually found his body in the foam\nbelow.\nIt’s a great spectacle held continuously in the Niagara Falls ring in\nthe honky-tonk tent of the great cosmic circus.\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:15:31 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.
