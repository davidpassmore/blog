The 386-acre Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex\n(Figure 1) is adjacent to the Ohio River in Potter\nand Center townships near the borough of Monaca in Beaver County,\nPennsylvania (“Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex,” n.d.a, “Project\ndevelopment”). Polyethylene is a feedstock for manufacturing\nplastic products, especially packaging and auto components. Polyethylene\nis produced from ethylene created from steam processing of ethane, a\nnatural gas liquid found in some gas streams in the Marcellus and Utica\nshale formations.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex Under\nConstruction.  (Photo Taken in March 2022 by David Passmore.)\n\n\n\nShell has confirmed that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will\ncommence operations in 2022 (Shrum 2022a). In December 2021, a Shell\nChemical Appalachia executive said that “Much of the work is done….Now\nwe are tying the various larger structures together” (Suttles 2020). One estimate places the\ncost of the Complex at $10 billion (Schneider 2019).\nWhy Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? “The basic answer is very\nsimple,” said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At\nthe time, Visser was an executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia. Visser\nsaid, “You’re sitting here on a world-class resource base at the\ndoorstep of your customer (Cocklin 2016a).” Leaders of oil and gas\nindustry associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia noted\nthat “Our three states produce roughly one-third of America’s natural\ngas, making Appalachia the third largest gas producer in the world –\nbehind only the U.S. itself and Russia” (Callahan, Brundrett, and Burd 2022).\nMore than 70% of the North American polyethylene market exists within a\n700-mile radius of the Complex (“Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex,”\nn.d.b, “Project development”).\nGist (2016) wrote that\n“The Shell cracker represents one of the biggest-ever industrial\ninvestments in the tristate region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West\nVirginia), whose industrial sector suffered a series of set-backs\nthrough the second half of the 20th century (para. 4).” Whitfield and Rajeevee (2018)\ndescribed a study [“Report and Plans Released for Enhancing\nPetrochemicals, Plastics Manufacturing in Pennsylvania” (2017)]1 for the Team Pennsylvania Foundation\n(“Team PA Foundation,” n.d.)\nthat predicted “significant new investments in energy infrastructure\nsuch as gas gathering lines, pipelines, storage facilities, and\nfractionation plants (para. 3).\nShell stuck with its decision to invest in the Complex, even though\nmany Shell projects worldwide were delayed, resized, or canceled\naltogether due to a downturn in worldwide oil and gas markets as the\nComplex project commenced (Davis 2016).\nIn This Blog Posting….\nIn the remainder of this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and gaps\nin information that could influence the perceptions of the economic\nimpact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. The flow of this blog\nposting follows three threads:2\nFirst, I delineate some questions about the markets affecting the\nComplex, the worthiness of public expenditures on the Complex, and the\nregional economic effects that the public expects from the operation. I\nhighlight the importance of evidence about the expected economic impact\nto promote public acceptance of the Complex and to stimulate the need\nfor public expenditures to support the Complex.\nNext, I outline my simple understanding of the steps in operating\nthe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Understanding the nature and\nstructure of inputs, processes, and outputs of the Complex shapes\nexpectations for the regional economic impact of the Complex.\nAnd, last, I critically examine a report by professors associated\nwith Robert Morris University that was supported by Shell Chemical\nAppalachia LLC. This report, Updated Economic Impact Analysis:\nPetrochemical Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania (Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark 2021a),\nwas produced before the Complex will open for business. Many readers of\nthe Robert Morris report might view information presented as persuasive\nevidence about the potential positive impact of the Complex on the\nregional economy.3\nQuestions\nRemain About the  Viability of the Complex\nCan\nProduct and Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?\nRisk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels and\nproducts derived from these fuels. In September 2020, Moody’s (2020) raised\nquestions about the creditworthiness of new fossil fuel projects.\nMarkets, regulations, and environmental concerns affecting the quality\nof human life are influencing the viability of the business proposition\nfor added fossil fuel capacity.\nAccording to a biting 2020 opinion offered by Sanzillo and Hipple (2020c), the\nPennsylvania Petrochemical Complex faces prospects of low product\nprices, price and supply volatility in ethane feedstock markets, risk of\noversupply of polyethylene resins that the Complex will manufacture,\nstiff competition from other producers, competition from the supply of\nrecycled plastics materials, and the influence of possible low general\neconomic growth (Figure 2 is a plot of recent natural\ngas price volatility). Concluded by the Institute was that the Complex\n“will open to market conditions that are more challenging than when the\nproject was planned. The [C]omplex is likely to be less profitable than\nexpected and face an extended period of financial distress (Sanzillo and Hipple (2020c), p.1;\nsee, also, Bruggers (2020) and Place (2022)).”\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Volatility of Natural Gas Prices, 2018-2021.\n (Plot from Disavino (2021).)\n\n\n\nTax\nExpenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Are Large…But Prudent?\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allocated funds to support the\npreparation of the site for the Complex in Monaca. In addition, the\nCommonwealth offered tax and financial incentives to site the Complex in\nPennsylvania. However, using the term “incentives” makes the\nCommonwealth’s decision sound distant from its financial accounting.\nMake no mistake, though. These incentives plainly are tax\nexpenditures, defined in an accounting sense by the U.S. Treasury\n(“Tax\nExpenditures,” n.d.; see, also, Hellerstein and Coenen\n1966, 793) as\n\nrevenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which\nallow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or\nwhich provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a\ndeferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as\nalternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or regulatory\nprograms. (para. 1)\n\nAs a consequence of excluding taxes and offering tax credits for the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, citizens of the Commonwealth forego\nthe opportunity to collect general fund revenue. Also, revenue reduction\nfrom these expenditures and credits could require the Commonwealth to\nraise taxes to remain revenue-neutral (Sammartino and Toder 2020, 4). In 2019,\nStacker, a news organization, calculated that the tax breaks allocated\nto the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex ranked 13th in dollar value\nout of 50 national projects receiving corporate subsidies from\ngovernments over 20 years (Crisafulli, n.d.).\nIf projects were judged on costs alone, few investments would occur.\nInstead, citizens must weigh the costs of public investment in this\nprivate venture against the benefits to the regional economy that could\naccrue from the operation of the Complex. As I will assert in more\ndetail in this blog posting, I do not believe that these benefits have\nbeen demonstrated well before the Complex will open.\nExpenditures for Site\nPreparation\nFunds from Act 2 of 1995 (“Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation\nStandards Act (Act of May. 19, 1995,p.l. 4, No. 2 Cl. 27) -\nLAND,” n.d.) – which supports remediation of tracts of\nland that were developed for industrial purposes, polluted and then\nabandoned (aka “brownfields”) – funded a portion of the costs\nof preparation of the site, which was the location of a former zinc\nsmelter. Remediation involved covering the site with clean fill,\ninstalling a synthetic cap over previous disposal areas on the property,\nand collecting and treating potentially contaminated storm water before\ndischarge (“Shell Petrochemical\nComplex,” n.d.a). Ate Visser, speaking for Shell at a\n2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh, said that construction of the\nComplex would have been impossible without Act 2 funds (Cocklin 2016b, para. 7).\nCommonwealth expenditures did not alone fund site preparation. Shell\nincurred significant expenses. For example, Shell committed $80 million\non top of Act 2 funds to clean up environmental contamination at the\nsite and prepare the land for construction of the Complex (Cocklin 2016b, para. 6). A PennDOT\nspokesman said Shell paid for a $60 million project to alter a\nCommonwealth roadway, Pennsylvania Route 18, and make other road fixes\nat the site (Bumsted 2016).\nAlso, Shell paid nearly $70 million to move Center Township’s water\nintake site and build Township a new water treatment plant. The water\nintake was located where Shell built docking facilities for equipment\ndelivery during the Complex’s construction phase (Cocklin 2016c, para. 4).\nTax\nExpenditures Offered as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania used tax expenditures as incentives\nfor siting petrochemical plants such as the Complex in Pennsylvania:\nAct 16 in 2012 (“Keystone Opportunity Zone, Keystone\nOpportunity Expansion Zone, and Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone\nAct – Omnibus Amendments (Act of Feb. 14, 2012, p. L. 183, No.\n16),” n.d.) makes petrochemical manufacturers like\nShell exempt from all corporate net income taxes and property taxes for\n15 years after first occupying the Beaver County site, as long as it\ninvests at least one billion dollars (not necessarily in Pennsylvania)\nand creates at least 400 new permanent full-time jobs. Shell said it\nwould deploy 600 jobs to operate the Complex (“Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex,”\nn.d.a, “Environment and society”).\nAct 85 in 2012 (“Tax Reform Code of 1971 – Omnibus Amendments\n(Act of Jul. 2, 2012, p. L. 751, No. 85),” n.d., “Article\nXVII-G”) gives Shell a tax credit of 5 cents for every gallon of\nethane it buys to manufacture ethylene, provided that 2,500 full-time\nequivalent jobs are created during construction of the Complex (≅6,000\nwere, according to Shell (“Shell Starts Main\nConstruction on Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in USA,”\nn.d.)). Shell will pay no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but\nShell can benefit by selling unused credits as tax equity for other\npurchasing firms to reduce their own tax liability.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pennsylvania Act 16 and Act 85.  (Images\ncaptured from www.legis.state.pa.us website  and edited by David\nPassmore)\n\n\n\nThomas Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought\nan annual $66 million tax credit for 25 years, a total of $1.65 billion.\nSuppose the Complex sustains between 400 to 600 jobs annually for 25\nyears, a rough, undiscounted calculation4\nindicates a cost per job, a recognized economic development metric\n(Sahota (n.d.) and UK Homes\n& Communities Agency (2015)),5\nover the 25-year period between $2.75 million and $13 million, which\nequals $165,000 to $112,000 per job per year. A dollar figure capping\nexpenditures was not placed in the final draft of the legislation,\nmeaning that the credits are unlimited and flexible (Bumsted 2012). Shell’s Visser said, “I\ncan tell you, with hand to my heart, that without these incentives, we\nwould not have made this investment decision (Cocklin 2016d, para. 6).” Governor\nCorbett, who steered these expenditures through legislation, said, “When\nyou’re looking at the investment you have to look at what it would have\ncost us had we done nothing, had we let these businesses go” (Detrow 2012c).\nAre Tax\nExpenditures Effective as Incentives?\nThe extant research literature examining the relationship between\noffering tax incentives and consequent economic growth is complex,\nvaried, and inconclusive (Buss 2001a, 94–100). In particular,\nevidence is weak that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader\neconomic growth at the state and local levels (Slattery and Zidar 2020). T. J. Bartik (2020) reported\nthat so-called “place-based” policies cost around $60 billion annually\n(in 2019 dollars) and that the typical state and local incentive offer,\nas a percent of the value-added of the business receiving an incentive,\ntripled in size in the 30 years preceding 2019.\nThe body of research is thin about the economic growth that resulted\nfrom using state and local expenditures of tax revenue to subsidize\nprivate firms. State governments prefer not to conduct rigorous\nevaluations of the costs and benefits of tax expenditures used to incent\nsite location (Buss 2001b). An\nopen question is whether Shell might have decided to relocate to the\nWest Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania region, if not Beaver County, even\nwithout incentives, especially if the region offers unique and desirable\nbusiness opportunities. According to T. Bartik (2018), in 9 out 10 cases firms receive a\ntax incentive for a location decision that they would have made, even if\nno incentive had been provided (p. 40 and note 60 on p. 127). Also, an\nimportant consideration is whether a location of the Complex in Ohio or\nWest Virginia, rather than Pennsylvania, would have been less beneficial\nfor Pennsylvania residents. As far as I know, the Commonwealth has not\nembarked on an assessment of the effectiveness of Act 16 and Act 85\nexpenditures on economic growth in the Commonwealth. The net public\nbenefit of tax expenditures made on the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex remains to be demonstrated.\nFood and\nWater Watch (2020) cataloged the long history of\nfailed tax incentives in Pennsylvania, including luring Volkswagen to\nWestmoreland County and the European shipbuilder Kvaerner to the\nPhiladelphia shipyard, enticing the Vanguard Group to keep its corporate\noffices from moving out of state, and offering state and city grants for\na Comcast building in Philadelphia (p. 4). Even so, Pennsylvania\nGovernor Corbett enthusiastically compared his announcement of the tax\nexpenditure deal with the petrochemical industry to “what it must have\nbeen like when the first steel mill was built in Pittsburgh, starting an\nindustry that had never been here before” (Murphy 2016). “I think it’s important\nnot only for the young generation but generations yet to be born,”\nCorbett said. “It’s going to establish an industry here in western\nPennsylvania that I think has the potential to grow to considerable\nsize.”\nWhat Are\nStakeholders’ Perspectives of the Complex?\nShell’s Stake,\nDifferent Than the Public’s\nThe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sums to a massive long-term\ninvestment of money, time, effort, and planning by Shell. Shell\nundoubtedly foresees a financial return from investing in the Complex,\neven though the Complex will face the vagaries of resource and product\nmarkets and emerging regulation, as will any forward-looking decision in\nthe energy sector. Shell makes decisions as a private enterprise with\nshared ownership among stockholders. As such, Shell properly must invoke\nthe criterion of “what’s in it for us and, ultimately, our shareholders”\nin its decisions.\nDeep inside the company’s spreadsheets, Shell must have weighed on a\nfinely-tuned scale the current and future costs, risks, uncertainties,\nrevenue, and profits in the balance of its worldwide business efforts to\nyield the momentous decision to move forward with the Complex.\nProceeding to build and operate the Complex was a complex, bold, and\ncourageous business decision made by one of the largest independent\nenergy firms in the world. Much is at stake for Shell.\nShell’s success also could positively impact the regional economy in\nproportion that the inputs purchased for the Pennsylvania Petrochemical\nComplex originate in the region and its outputs are sold and used\nsubsequently for manufacturing in the region. However, such an impact on\nthe regional economy is incidental and not essential for Shell’s\nfinancial success with the Complex. Obtaining a return from the\nCommonwealth’s tax expenditures is essential for Pennsylvania citizens,\nthough. The Commonwealth’s tax expenditures reduce Shell’s costs in\nexchange for a job, income. and wage tax possibilities derived in the\nshort term by construction and in the long term by operation of the\nComplex.\nThe Public’s\nInterest, Different Than Shell’s\nThrough the Commonwealth’s expenditures of tax revenues, Pennsylvania\ncitizens have become significant financial stakeholders in the Complex.\nYet, measures of success expected from the Complex by Pennsylvania\ncitizens are not the same as Shell’s. Citizens seek regional economic\nimpact from their investments in the form of jobs and income for\ncitizens and tax revenue for governments to fund public goods and\nservices. Commonwealth and local tax collection from Shell were foregone\nby state legislation, however.\nThese expenditures of tax revenues for Shell and other energy\ncompanies came at the same time as reduced Pennsylvania spending for\ncounty-level public health programs and other public services and an\nacross-the-board $1 billion cut in state spending (Detrow 2012d, para. 2).\nIn addition, negotiations about these expenditures remained hidden from\npublic view due to confidentiality agreements with Shell (Phillips 2012). Governor Thomas\nCorbett,\n\n“Pushed back against the argument the tax break is a corporate\ngiveaway, saying, ‘They think we’re giving money to them. No we’re not.\nWhat we’re saying is, you build it. You provide all these jobs for all\nthese people. And we’ll take a little less money from you, so we have\nmore money for us.’” (Detrow\n2012a)\n\nAny enterprise engaging in business transactions – even an enterprise\nso primitive as a child’s lemonade stand – generates an economic impact.\nSo, there is no doubt that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will\nhave some impact on the regional economy. But, in what way? By how much?\nWill the benefits of regional economic impact cover the costs of\nexpenditures of revenue collected from Pennsylvania citizens? Cui\nbono? Answers to these critical questions about the public benefits\nof the Complex would help justify expenditures on the Complex by\nPennsylvania citizens.\nAssertions\nof Potential Regional Impact Were  Influential in Opinions About the\nComplex\nWithout a doubt, several reports from the American Chemistry Council,\na trade association,6 framed the potential benefits of the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex for Pennsylvania citizens, their\nelected legislators, and public officials. In 2011, the Council reported\n(American\nChemistry Council and Statistics 2011, 1) that a 25% increase\nin ethane supply on growth in the petrochemical sector would generate\n17,000 new knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs in the U.S. chemical\nindustry and 395,000 additional jobs outside the chemical industry. Also\nconcluded was that this investment would generate $4.4 billion more in\nfederal, state, and local tax revenue annually ($43.9 billion over 10\nyears).\nIn 2012, the American Chemistry Council issued an addendum to their\nnational report that focused on the economic impact of natural gas\ndevelopment in Pennsylvania. The Council asserted that an additional\n$4.8 billion in chemical industry activity would generate over 2,400\nhigh-paying, desirable jobs in the Pennsylvania chemical industry (American\nChemistry Council and Statistics 2012a, para. 4). In\naddition, new petrochemical production in Pennsylvania would stimulate\npurchases of raw materials, services, and other purchases throughout the\nsupply chain, producing more than 8,200 indirect jobs and generating\n7,000 payroll-induced jobs in the state. A one-time $3.2 billion\ninvestment in a Pennsylvania petrochemical complex would result in more\nthan $900 million in spending inside the state of Pennsylvania (American\nChemistry Council and Statistics 2012b, para. 6) \nThe Council also indicated that construction of a petrochemical\nfacility, purchase of new equipment for the facility, and operation of\nthe facility would result in federal and state tax revenues of $363\nmillion and local tax revenues of $141 million (American\nChemistry Council and Statistics 2012c, Table 3 and Table\n4).\nThese reports were influential at the front edge of the advancing\nnatural gas revolution, the “pivot of the world’s energy future” (Kolb 2014), in Pennsylvania and other\nstates in the northeast United States. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\ndid not produce its own independent study of the potential economic\nimpact of ethane cracking and plastic resin production in Pennsylvania\n(S. Detrow 2012a)\n– nor did it finish a study that it started in time to affect\nlegislation on tax expenditures (S. Detrow 2012b, para. 10). Pennsylvania\nGovernor Thomas Corbett trusted the American Chemistry Council’s\nestimates of potential economic impact (Detrow 2012b).\nThe American Chemical Society’s reports about the potential economic\nimpact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex were the linchpins in\nthe appeal that secured the allocation of tax expenditures through Act\n16 and Act 85 to support the construction and operation of the Complex.\nHowever, questions remain about the validity of the American Chemical\nSociety estimates of the potential economic impact of the Complex and,\ntherefore, whether the reports demonstrated the potential benefits from\nPennsylvania citizens’ investment in the Complex.\nUpdated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in\nBeaver County, Pennsylvania (Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark 2021b), a\nreport written by professors associated with Robert Morris University\nfor Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC was released in 2021. For many\nreaders, this report provided evidence to satisfy questions raised about\nthe expected impact of the Complex on the regional economy before the\nComplex is commissioned in 2022.\nI believe that the report produced by Robert Morris University\nresearchers did not reduce the uncertainty about the wisdom of tax\nexpenditures on the Complex. I assert that conceptual and methodological\nquestions about this report from Robert Morris – and reflecting backward\non the American Chemistry Council reports conducted with similar methods\nand using the same software – negate justification for public\nexpenditures to support the construction and operation of the Complex. I\ndo not deny that regional economic benefits will flow from the\nComplex, just that the reports were inadequate to uphold decisions made\nto allocate public expenditure for the Complex.\nLeaders\nin the Commonwealth and Beyond Were Enthralled\nStudies released about the potential economic impact of the Complex\nmust have left a strong impression on the representatives of\nPennsylvania citizens and other leaders. Public officials – high and low\nand across the spectrum of politics – stood firmly behind the promise\nand in the bright light of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.\nIn 2019, President Trump visiting during construction of the Complex\nremarked that “These folks are from Shell, and this is a plant like no\nother. It’s just incredible….And we appreciate the investment, and we’re\ngoing to do everything possible to make [inaudible – perhaps, it\nsuccessful? It work?] (“Remarks by President Trump During Tour of\nthe Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex | Monaca, PA \nthe White House” 2019).” Governor Tom Corbett said,\n“The benefits to the state’s southwest and to all of Pennsylvania are\nimmense” (Gibson 2012a, para.\n9). Corbett felt that public investment in the Complex would\nleave a legacy of benefits for Pennsylvanians. He said, “What this does\n— it talks about whoever is governor after me, two or five governors\nafter me, having an economy that is growing based on manufacturing that\ndoes not exist right now. So they will have money for education, for\nsocial services” (Detrow 2012c, para.\n19).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Former President Trump Visits Site of Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex, August 2019  (Image from https://tinyurl.com/trumpvisit)\n\n\n\nGeneral bipartisan praise for the Complex mirrored the enthusiasm of\nTrump and Corbett. For instance, State Senator Mike Kelly, a Democrat,\nwelcomed the decision and praised Governor Corbett, saying, “Today’s\nannouncement by Shell is a great day for all Pennsylvanians….I\nespecially want to commend Governor Tom Corbett and his economic team\nfor their efforts in securing this economic development project for\nPennsylvania. Kudos to all who worked to bring this home and make it\nhappen” (Gibson 2012a, para. 16\nand para. 21).\nState Senator Jay Costa, also a Democrat, applauded “the governor’s\nand the community’s efforts to land such a valuable enterprise and bring\nhome the benefits this plant will provide for generations to come” (Gibson 2012b, para. 21). Marcellus Shale\nCoalition President Kathyrn Klaber noted that Shell’s decision to invest\nin the Complex was a “further indication of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania and Governor Corbett’s continued work to responsibly\ndevelop the Marcellus and expand broad-based economic benefits for all”\n(Gibson 2012c, para.\n6).\nI defer to a subsequent major section of this blog posting my\ncritical review of the recent report from Robert Morris University, a\ncritical perspective which I believe applies similarly to the almost\ndecade-old American Chemical Society reports. Necessarily prior, though,\nto motivate my criticisms is a common understanding of the inputs,\nprocesses, and outputs forming the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.\nSo, next, I offer my bare-bones description of the operation of the\nComplex and refer to the information in this description in my\nsubsequent review of the Robert Morris report.\nOperation\nof the Pennsylvania  Petrochemicals Complex\nThe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven\nethane cracker units,7 two high-density polyethylene units\nand one low-density polyethylene resin manufacturing unit (potential of\n1,600,000 metric tons of polyethylene annually), natural gas-fired\ncombustion turbines co-producing steam and electricity, four emergency\ndiesel generators, diesel-powered pumps, cooling towers, multiple fuel\nand storage tanks, multiple flaring units, an incinerator, air pollution\ncontrol devices, and a wastewater treatment facility (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b; State of\nPennsylvania 2016, 5–7).8\nDisplayed in Figure 5 is my conception of the\ninputs, processes, and outputs of the Complex. For simplicity of\npresentation, the flow of activity portrayed in Figure\n5 skims over many of the details of the\nethane-to-ethylene-to-plastic resin process. I narrate some of the\ndetails about inputs, processes, and outputs that flow from top to\nbottom of Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Inputs, Processes, and Outputs in the Operation\nof Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.  (Graphic drawn by\nDavid Passmore using DiagrammeR package in RStudio based on  general\ndescriptions of ethane cracking and statements in air quality approval\n application made by Shell (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b). Does not  show the\nflow of emmissions from utilites and general facilities processes \nor fugitive emissions.)\n\n\n\nInputs\nThe Complex can produce 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene annually\nby cracking ethane molecules (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b, 1–2).9 All\nof the ethane required is delivered to the Complex by the Falcon Ethane\nPipeline System, a 97-mile pipeline network incoming to the Complex from\nHouston, Pennsylvania, and Cadiz and Scio in Ohio. (see Figure\n6). Ethane transported by Falcon is unique — it is\nthe only energy commodity that can morph from being sold mixed with\nnatural gas or, alternatively, as a liquid feedstock for petrochemical\nplants, an attribute that contributes to ethane’s volatility of\nproduction volume and price. (Braziel 2022). As with many aspects of\nthe construction and operation of the Complex, the Falcon Ethane\nPipeline System has generated considerable controversy (see, e.g., “Real Talk on\nPipelines” 2022).\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Falcon Ethane Pipeline.  (Map from https://bit.ly/FalconPipeline)\n\n\n\nGas processing plants that separate liquids and remove solids or\nother particulate matter in the gas stream lifted from regional wells\ndrawing from Marcellus and Utica shale formations provide input to these\nthree nodes in the pipeline network. The three modes are tactically\nlocated proximal to clusters of wells producing “wet” gas. Some wells\nproduce not only natural gas as methane, but also include natural gas\nliquids such as ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane. These products\nconstitute as liquids by, depending on the gas pressure, condensing to\nbecome the “wet” portion of the natural gas (Hey\n2017). In general, Marcellus and Utica shale formations in\nOhio, southwestern Pennsylvania, and West Virginia involve wet gas (See\nFigure 7 for locations).\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Locations of Wet and Dry Gas in Marcellus and Utica\nShale Formations.  (Map from https://bit.ly/wet-dry-gas)\n\n\n\nNatural-gas-fired cogeneration turbines will produce steam for the\nethane cracker and generate electricity for the Complex. Excess\nelectricity generated through cogeneration will be sold for distribution\nin daily energy markets run by the PJM Interconnection electrical power\ngrid serving selected northeastern U.S. states (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b, 1–2). As much as\none-third of the electricity output of the cogeneration units might\nbecome available for regional distribution (“New Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex Takes Advantage of Shale Revolution,”\nn.d.).\nSuperheated pressurized steam in the cracker dilutes and vaporizes\nethane. The heat from the steam splits the bonds between carbon and\nhydrogen atoms in ethane, a process called “pyrolysis,” to yield\nethylene (more detail in Passmore (2022c), para, 5).\nOil & Gas Journal (Brelsford 2021) reported that the\nComplex also will draw 20 million gallons of water daily from the Ohio\nRiver. Some water not used to generate steam is used to cool the\neffluent produced by the cracker or to contribute to other processes at\nthe Complex. Water is reused or returned to the river as a by-product\nafter treatment to meet water quality standards. A by-product is a\nmaterial produced as a residual of, or incidental to, the production\nprocess. In an accounting sense, by-products are associated with\ncosts.\nUnknown are the amounts and kinds of other inputs to the Complex\nbeyond ethane, natural gas, and water. These other inputs could add to\nthe costs of business of the Complex and affect the supply chain for the\nComplex in similarly unknown ways.\nProcesses\nAt the core of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex are ethane\ncrackers that generate ethylene for making polymer resin that, in turn,\nis extruded as small pellets.\nCracking\nAn ethane cracker is a furnace into which ethane is fed. The ethane\nis diluted with steam heated to approximately 1300° F. The heat of the\nfurnace cracks ethylene from ethane molecules, freeing two molecules of\nhydrogen in the process and creating a double bond10\nbetween carbon atoms (structures modeled in Figure 8).\nThe hot gas mixture exhausted from the cracker is cooled, or “quenched\n(“Quench Water Coolers in Ethane Cracking\nPlant (Olefin Plant) - Hydrocarbons Technology,”\nn.d.),” with water to prevent further chemical reactions.\nWater and heat are recovered for recycling back into the cracking\nprocess, although some water is treated and discharged as a by-product\nof the Complex (Partlow\n2022).\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of the Chemical Structures of Ethane and\nEthylene.  (Image from https://insights.globalspec.com/images/assets/490/1490/LNG-04a.jpg)\n\n\n\nEthylene and other substances exhausting in a gaseous state from the\ncracker are compressed to a liquid state and then refrigerated.\nFractional distillation further separates ethylene from the cooled,\nquenched mixture by taking advantage of differences in the vaporization\npoint of ethylene compared with other chemical components of the mixture\n(Helmenstine,\nn.d.b).\nVarious gases that are by-products of cracking are burned into the\nair in a controlled combustion process called “flaring” (“Flaring - Energy Education,”\nn.d.), which releases carbon dioxide into the air as a\nby-product. Wastewater not reused in the cracking process but containing\nby-products from the cracker is collected, treated, and discharged.\nThen, the ethylene produced is stored for manufacturing plastic\nresins.\nAn important point of information is that Shell does not report\nethylene cracked from ethane as a product of the Complex that is meant\nto be sold to customers. Its sole use is for creating plastic resin.\nLiquification of ethylene not used in polyethylene production is\npossible but not indicated for the Complex.11 I\nhave not found any indication that Shell will produce ethylene as a\nco-product of the Complex.\nShell indicated that some co-products, such as “Solid components\n(coke/pitch/tar) are removed…and sent offsite for either use or disposal\n[and]….tar and light gasoline [are}…shipped offsite for further\nprocessing into products” (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b, 3–4), although the\nvolume and possible commercial value of these co-products are not\nreported. Co-products are goods or services that are incidental to main\nproduction and have market value to generate revenue. In contrast, a\nby-product typically is a material that is a consequence of production\nassociated with costs.\nEthylene produced at the Complex is the primary input to polyethylene\nmanufacturing, the next and final production stage in the Complex.\nEthane cracking gathers more attention than polymerization probably\nbecause the ethane cracker forms a large footprint at the Complex and\nconsumes most inputs of ethane, water, electricity, and steam to the\nComplex. The final product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex\nsold to customers is, in fact, pelletized polyethylene resin, not\nethylene. The nature of the final product manufactured at the\nComplex has significant consequences for the validity of estimates made\nof the economic impact of the Complex. More to that point\nsubsequently in this blog posting.\nPolymerization\nUnique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single\nchemical bonds with up to four other atoms and to double or triple bond\nwith itself, as in a double-bond ethylene molecule (again, see Figure\n8). Carbon is one of the only elements, because of its\nbonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped molecules to form\nthe basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and\nproteins that serve as the basis of life itself. Chaining together\nethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical process called\npolymerization produces polyethylene (a polymer, which means\n“many parts”).\nA catalyst suspended with ethylene molecules under pressure initiates\npolyethylene production. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up\nchemical reactions, but is not consumed during the reaction. The\ncatalyst bonds ethylene monomers into a long chain forming a polymer\n(see Figure 9 showing monomer and an\nn-length polymer). The polymerization process releases high\namounts of heat.12 As a consequence, continuous\ncooling is required to prevent runaway chemical reactions (Burdett and Eisinger 2018a, 67) that\ncould ruin the product or manufacturing equipment.\nEthylene passes to two gas-phase polyethylene units and one slurry\ntechnology unit to manufacture low-density polyethylene and high-density\npolyethylene. Processes in both units employ catalysts, but use\ndifferent equipment and operating parameters to produce each specific\ngrade of polyethylene. After the inclusion of additives and further\nconditioning, the polymer is extruded to form pellets, the primary\nproduct of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Ethylene Monomers React With a Catalyst to Create\nPolyethylene.  (Image from “How Polymer Branching & Molecular Weight\nImpact Processability” (n.d.))\n\n\n\nOutputs\nPlastic resin in pellet form is the product of the Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex that has market value for Shell. At the same\ntime, the Complex accumulates by-products of its industrial processes\nthat have consequences for public health and environmental quality.\nPolyethylene Resin Pellets\nPolyethylene has many desirable attributes for manufacturing. In\ngeneral, Kaiser (2021) noted that\npolyethylene can handle large loads without fracture and is flexible and\nstretchable. Polyethylene is light and versatile and absorbs no water.\nLow-density polyethylene resists many types of chemical reactions and\nimpact, while allowing relatively easy fabrication and forming.\nHigh-density polyethylene is known for its outstanding tensile strength,\nlarge strength-to-density ratio, high-impact resistance, and high\nmelting point.\nPolyethylene is an excellent electrical insulator and can be produced\nto be transparent. Polyethylene has thermoplastic properties useful in\nproduction – i.e., it softens or fuses when heated and hardens and\nbecomes rigid again when cooled. The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex\nwill produce high- and low-density polyethylene (see, respectively,\n“What Is High Density\nPolyethylene (HDPE)? | Acme Plastics” (n.d.) and “Low Density Poly-Ethylene - an Overview |\nScienceDirect Topics” (n.d.)).\nNearly all polyethylene is sold after initial manufacturing as small\n(≅5mm), white, lentil-shaped pellets (see Figure 10),\nalthough round, flat, square, cylindrical, and various other shapes of\nmany colors are manufactured. The pellets are known as “nurdles.”\nNurdles are bagged and stored before distribution by rail or truck to\nwarehouses or directly to customers. The added cost of pelletizing\npolyethylene is considerable (Burdett and Eisinger 2018b, 67), but\nnurdles are relatively easy to ship. Customers who buy pellets are not\nhouseholds, but are other businesses that use the nurdles in their own\nproduction, such as injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: White Nurdles.  (Photo from gentlemanrook -\noriginally posted to Flickr as Plastic Pellets - \"Nurdles\",  CC BY\n2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4487785)\n\n\n\nPlastic resin pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in\ndownstream markets. Pellet prices are volatile (Pederson 2021) because they are driven\non the supply side by equally volatile prices for natural gas and on the\ndemand side by two major factors. First, consumers express preferences\nfor “eco-friendly” packaging solutions. Second, environmental regulation\nof plastic products is increasing. Some observers believe nurdles are\none of the most harmful toxic wastes released into the environment (see\ndiscussion by McVeigh (n.d.)).\nBy-Products\nMany industrial processes create co-products and by-products.13 The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex will generate electricity and, perhaps, some output of cracking\nas co-products. However, the Complex will create by-products, the cost\nof which Shell will bear, partly by paying for permits to discharge\nsubstances into the environment. Other costs of by-products will be\nborne separately by Pennsylvania citizens or jointly with Shell.\nCracking ethane emits by-products that can render the air, soil,\nwater, or other natural resources harmful or unsuitable for further use.\nThe Environmental Law Institute (n.d.) and Doyle (n.d.) inventoried many of the\nby-products of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex that could pose\nthreats to human health and environmental safety.\nSmall inhalable particles emitted can damage short- and long-term\nhuman respiratory function. Volatile organic compounds emanate from\ncracking, such as ground-level ozone, benzene, and toluene, associated\nwith respiratory and other health ailments. Permitted in treated\nwastewater to be discharged to the Ohio River are certain levels of\nbenzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and vinyl chloride that are established human\ncarcinogens.\nCracking also releases carbon dioxide, a gas that can absorb energy\nwithin infrared wavelengths. Collision with other molecules transfers\nthis energy. Faster molecular motion produces heat. Trapped heat from\nthis action of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is the\n“greenhouse effect” that has influenced the long-term warming of the\nplanet’s overall temperature.\nThe Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 2015),\nvalid through 2019,14 for the kinds and numbers of tons\nof annual emissions by the Complex listed in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1.

The Department keeps a running list of news on its website\n(see “Shell\nPetrochemical Complex” (n.d.b) ) about the Complex, permits and\napprovals obtained for the construction and operation of the facility,\nand compliance/enforcement actions taken by government agencies to\nregulate the Complex.\nHow\nWell Understood is the Potential  Economic Impact of Complex?\nShell Chemical Appalachia LLC made a complex, courageous, and\nconsequential financial decision to build and operate the Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex. Shell says that the Complex will open sometime\nin 2022 (Shrum 2022b). The\nCommonwealth’s citizens also invest with Shell in the Complex. Foregoing\ncurrent and future tax expenditures by the Commonwealth reduced Shell’s\nstart-up costs, will subsidize purchases of ethane for cracking, and\neliminates much of Shell’s state and local tax liability.\nAlthough Shell and the Commonwealth invest jointly in the Complex,\ntheir investment goals differ. Shell aims to sell plastic pellets from\nthe Complex for a profit. The Commonwealth wishes to benefit from the\nimpact the Complex could have on regional jobs, income, business\nactivity, and tax revenue.\nShell will review its balance sheets and earnings reports to judge\nits yield from the Complex. The Commonwealth certainly can review\nregional economic data that will emerge to account for the observed\nimpact of the operation of the Complex, although I am not aware of any\nimpact assessment plan. Shell-sponsored forecasts of the potential\neconomic impact of the Complex seem to have provided the rationale for\naccepting the Commonwealth’s decision to invest in the Complex. However,\npotential ≠ a realized outcome.\nI conclude that reports about the forecasts made public by Shell\nmight have included conceptual orientations and methodological\napproaches that left the Commonwealth’s citizens without clear evidence\nof potential economic impact. Therefore, some explanation of my\nassessment is appropriate of the value of Shell’s forecasts of potential\nimpact to justify Pennsylvania citizens’ trust in investment in the\nComplex.\nIn this major section of this blog posting, I critically review a\n2021 report about the potential regional economic impact of the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex (portions of cover in Figure\n11. The preparation of this report, Updated Economic\nImpact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County,\nPennsylvania (Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021b), was supported by Shell Chemical Appalachia\nLLC. The importance of this report is that some among the public and its\nrepresentatives might perceive that it satisfies questions about\nregional economic value of the Complex.15\nWhen the Robert Morris report16 was released in 2021,\nthe report’s authors were identified as faculty members in the School of\nBusiness at Robert\nMorris University. Earlier similarly produced economic impact\nreports by the American Chemistry Council appeared while the\nPennsylvania legislature was considering incentives through tax\nexpenditures to aid the construction and operation of the Complex. I\nbelieve that these Council reports share nearly the same methodology and\nanalytics, as well as some of the same issues, evident in the Robert\nMorris report by Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark (2021b).\nDissection of the Robert Morris report can also shed light on the\nAmerican Chemistry Council reports’ validity.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Cover of Robert Morris University Report. \n(Image captured from https://bit.ly/RMpetro and  edited to minimize\ndisplay space by David Passmore )\n\n\n\nI structure my critical review of the Robert Morris report along\nthree lines:\nSummary and Reflection. First, I summarize the Robert\nMorris report, accompanied by light annotation about some of the methods\napplied to generate the report.\nIssues. Next, I identify three issues in the Robert Morris\nreport that left the Commonwealth’s citizens without clear evidence of\nthe potential economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex: classification of the industry accounting for impact,\nidentification of indirect impact, and appropriateness of a 40-year\nforecast of impact.\nNext Steps. Last, I describe briefly some ways that might\nprove useful for assessing any regional economic impact of the Complex.\nAs far as I know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform any impact\nassessment.\nThe Robert\nMorris Report: A Summary and Reflection\nFocus\nShell engaged Robert Morris faculty members “to provide an\nindependent analysis17 of the economic impact of the\nconstruction and operation of the contemplated petrochemical facility”\nby examining “direct economic changes in job creation and overall\neconomic output, focusing on the construction and operational phases of\nthe Project. Additionally, the multiplicative impacts of the Project are\nconsidered” (Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021d, 7).\nImpact Estimation\nThe analytics behind the report rely on input-output modeling, a\ndata-based, computational, and most often prospective approach to\nunwinding the impact of projects, events, and changes in local\neconomies. An input-output model accounts for goods and services that\nare required as inputs by industries to produce outputs of goods and\nservices necessary to satisfy requirements for supplies to other\nindustries or for delivery directly to consumers (Miernyk 1965).\nImpact estimates computed for the Robert Morris report relied\nexclusively on IMPLAN software (“Economic Impact Analysis for Planning |\nIMPLAN” 2019) for input-output modeling to analyze\n“publicly available information” (Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark 2021e,\niii). IMPLAN is described as the “gold standard” for economic\nimpact analysis. An essay I authored (Passmore 2022a) describes the technical\ndetails of input-output modeling.\nAlthough the regional economic impacts of building the Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex probably are substantial, construction is nearly\ncomplete as I write this blog posting. I, therefore, exclude\nconstruction impacts and, instead, emphasize the portions of the Robert\nMorris report focused on operating the Complex. I also exclude from my\nsummary portions of the report that estimate the statewide impacts of\nthe Complex. Clinton,\nMinutolo, and O’Roark (2021b) indicated that “Most of the\nimpact for the proposed Project is expected to occur in Beaver County,\nPennsylvania and SWPA [southwestern Pennsylvania]” (p. 10).\nGeography of Potential\nImpact\nThe core of the Robert Morris report focused on Beaver County and,\nthen, on a 10-county region of southwestern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania\ncounties comprised of Allegheny, Beaver, Armstrong, Butler, Fayette,\nGreen, Indiana, Lawrence, Westmoreland, and Washington form the\n10-county region (see Figure 12).18\nClinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark (2021b) constrained the analysis to these\n10 counties even though, “It is anticipated that border counties in Ohio\nand West Virginia will be impacted” (p. 10).\n\n\n\nFigure 12: 10-County Region in Southwestern, Pennsylvania.\n (Map created by David Passmore using online tool  at https://www.mapchart.net/usa-counties.html\n\n\n\nClinton, Minutolo,\nand O’Roark (2021b) assumed workers from the\n10-county region will fill 90% of jobs at the Complex and that 40% to\n75% of the people who fill the new jobs will live in Beaver County\n(p. 13). These assumptions seem reasonable.\nMy analysis of the flow of workers into and out of Beaver County in\n2019 (Figure 13) demonstrates that about one-half of\nworkers in Beaver County also lived in the county and that another\none-half traveled from outside Beaver County to work in the county. At\nthe same time, almost 49,000 residents of Beaver County traveled to work\noutside the county.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Flow of Workers In and Out of Beaver County,\nPennsylvania, 2019.  (Image created by David Passmore from\ninflow/outflow analysis  of Beaver County using LEHD On-The-Map \nat https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/ )\n\n\n\nMy analysis of distances from work to home for all Beaver County\nworkers in 2019, shown in Figure 13, reveals that\none-half of all Beaver County workers lived within 10 miles of their\nplaces of work. Another one-quarter of Beaver County workers traveled\nfrom 10 to 24 miles from work to their places of residence. The\nremainder traveled more than 25 miles from work in Beaver County to\nhome. Data not shown in Figure 13 revealed that almost\ntwo-thirds of workers traveling 50 or more miles from work in Beaver\nCounty went to homes north, northeast, and east of Beaver County. Also,\n40% of workers traveling home between 25 and 50 miles went to homes\nsoutheast of Beaver County (i.e., from the direction of Westmoreland\nCounty).\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Distance Traveled from Work to Home in Beaver\nCounty, Pennsylvania, 2019.  (Image created by David Passmore\nfrom distance/destination analysis  of Beaver County using LEHD\nOn-The-Map  at https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/ )\n\n\n\nOne impediment to defining an economic region by geopolitical\nboundaries, such as county lines, is the risk of misspecifying the\neconomic region expected to be affected by the Complex. An economic\nregion is a cohesive area in which commerce takes place. Of course,\nadministrative or geographical boundaries can define an economic region,\nespecially if governments govern commerce or terrain limits movement.\nHowever, commerce rarely respects map lines or many other\nimpediments.\nOther factors can define the economic region for the Complex, such as\nits laborshed (i.e., the region from which the facility draws its\ncommuting workers, as I have provided in Figures 13 and\n14) and proximal regional suppliers (i.e., firms close\nenough geographically to the Complex to supply goods and services).\nPerhaps a worthy approach moving forward will be to amend the boundaries\nof the economic region affected by the Complex to reflect the local\nsupply of goods, services, and labor. Such as approach might properly\ninclude, for example, parts of Ohio or areas north of Beaver County, or,\nperhaps, removal of Fayette or Green counties from the economic region\nthe Complex affects. Let the data that emerge after the Complex begins\noperation guide the establishment of the boundaries of the economic\nregion that the Complex affects.\nEstimates of Potential\nImpact\nJob numbers for the operation of the complex were the sole inputs\ninto the IMPLAN software to initiate the estimates in Table 1.19 Some assumptions stated in the\nreport about job numbers that formed the starting point for\nestimation:\n\nthe Beaver County petrochemical facility will employ 600 fulltime\npeople who will live and work in the region. We model the economic\nimpact of this job creation on the Pennsylvania economy assuming that\nall workers who fill these jobs will reside in the Commonwealth. We also\nmodel the economic impact in SWPA assuming that 90% of the people who\nfill the new jobs reside in the region. Thus, 540 new jobholders will\nwork and live in SWPA. Finally, we consider the impact of the new jobs\non Beaver County. Based on comparative commuting patterns we assume that\n40% to 75% of the people who fill the new jobs will live in Beaver\nCounty, generating 240 to 450 new jobs for people who reside there.\n(Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021f, 13)\n\nThe authors reported that they analyzed the “Petroleum Refinery\noperation” industry (Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021f, 8–9) to calculate the potential regional\neconomic impact of the Complex. After excluding construction and\nstatewide impact from my consideration, I extracted from the Robert\nMorris report and then recorded in Table 2 the potential economic\nimpacts of operating a petroleum refinery on Beaver County, on a\n10-county southwestern Pennsylvania area, and resulting from 40 years of\nrefinery activity.\n\nTable 2.

Some of these concepts and terms are drawn from\ndefinitions used in national income and product accounting by the U.S.\nBureau of Economic Analysis (“NIPA Handbook: Concepts and Methods of the\nu.s. National Income and Product Accounts | u.s. Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis (BEA)” 2021; “Glossary | u.s. Bureau of Economic Analysis\n(BEA),” n.d.). Others are derived from the language\nused around input-output analysis (Clouse,\nn.d.b). Readers of reports of economic impact often impute\ndifferent meanings of economic and technical concepts and methods than\nare intended by producers of reports.\nThe relationships and overlaps among some of the components of\neconomic impact reported in Table 2 are shown in Figure\n15. The components shown in Figure 15\nare terms used in national income and product accounting. The components\nare organized hierarchically into overlapping categories.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Relationships Among Some of the Components of\nRegional Economic Output,  Most of Which Are Estimated in the Robert\nMorris Report. (Image captured and recolored from https://bit.ly/IMPLANoutput)\n\n\n\nDefinitions of components of impact displayed in Table 2 include:\nLabor income equals employee compensation plus proprietors’\nincome.Employee compensation is the sum of employee wages and\nsalaries and supplements to wages and salaries. Wages and salaries are\nmeasured on an accrual, or “when earned” basis, which may be different\nfrom the measure of wages and salaries measured on a disbursement, or\n“when paid” basis. Supplements to wages and salaries include employer\ncontributions for employee pension and insurance funds and of employer\ncontributions for government social insurance.\nProprietor’s income is current–production income (including\nincome in–kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of\ntax–exempt cooperatives. Fees of corporate directors are included in\nincome of proprietors, but the imputed net rental income of\nowner–occupants of all dwellings is included in rental income of\npersons. Proprietors’ income excludes dividends and monetary interest\nreceived by nonfinancial businesses along with rental incomes received\nby persons not primarily engaged in the real estate business. These\nincomes are included in dividends, net interest, and rental income of\npersons, respectively.\n\nValue added is labor income plus taxes paid on\nproduction and imports and other property income.\nTaxes paid on production and imports, accounted as a\nnegative value, include include sales and excise taxes, customs duties,\nproperty taxes, motor vehicle licenses, severance taxes, other taxes,\nand special assessments.\nOther property income includes consumption of fixed\ncapital, corporate profits, and net of business current transfer\npayments. It also includes income derived from dividends, royalties,\ncorporate profits, and interest income.\n\nTotal output is the sum of value added plus\nintermediate output. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\ndefines intermediate output as “Goods and services that are used in the\nproduction process of other goods and services and are not sold in\nfinal-demand markets” (“Glossary: Intermediate\nInputs,” n.d.). Intermediate Inputs are purchases of\nnon-durable goods and services such as energy, materials, and purchased\nservices that are used for the production of other goods and services,\nrather than for final consumption. Purchases of intermediate goods are\nbusiness-to-business transactions. The Complex produces output that\nbecomes an intermediate input to other producers of plastic product\noutput.\nJobs equal the count of part– and full–time jobs, including\nall federal, state, and local government employment, military\nemployment, and self–employment. This definition does not count “in–kind\nwork” without pay by family members as employment.\nState and local earned income taxes were not calculated\ninside the IMPLAN model. Instead, the authors of the Robert\nMorris report calculated tax impacts outside the model using\ndata from the model. The authors explain:\n\nThe project is expected to exert a substantial impact on state and\nlocal taxes. There will be a number of tax impacts such as income tax,\nproperty tax, and licenses and permits. The income tax is the most\ntractable. We assume a 3.07% state income tax rate for the Pennsylvania\nwage income and a 1% local rate. Given that labor income in the model\nincludes both wages and benefits we assume that benefits are 34% of\nwages so that 75% of labor income would be taxed as wages and 25% would\nnot be taxed because it relates to nontaxable benefits. (Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark 2021f,\n15)\n\nTotal economic impacts on value added, labor income, and jobs are\nparsed in panel I of Table 2 into direct, indirect, and induced\ncomponents as (using definitions by\nIMPLAN):\nDirect impacts are the initial effects on the economy of\nthe Complex. For example, referencing Table 2, the number of direct jobs\nin Beaver County is 240 to 450, depending on assumptions about the\nactivity of the Complex. That is the range of the number of jobs that\nthe Complex could possibly employ.\nIndirect impacts are the effects of purchases of supplies\nby the Complex from local industries. The range of jobs generated by the\nComplex indirectly in local supplying industries is between 267 and 501.\nSome supplies are purchased outside Beaver County and, therefore, are\nnot attributed to the impact of the Complex in the county.\nInduced impacts are effects of the regional economy that\nresult from local spending of income earned by workers in the Complex\nand by workers in local industries that supply the Complex. The range of\njobs induced by the Complex is between 270 and 494. Some of the income\nearned by workers at the Complex and workers in local supplying\nindustries leaks outside the county or the southwestern region.\nThe sum of direct, indirect, and induced components in panel I of\nTable 2 is an estimate of the total potential impacts (depicted in\nFigure 16) of the Complex on regional value added,\nlabor income, and jobs. Impacts-by-component, excluding taxes, were\ncalculable only for estimates in panel I of Table. In another blog\nposting, I detail the technical aspects of calculating these impacts\n(Passmore (2022b),\n“Multipliers”).\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Components the Total Economic Impact of the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.  (Graphic drawn by David\nPassmore using DiagrammeR package in RStudios.)\n\n\n\nDid\nEconomics Play a Role in the Assessment  of the Potential Economic\nImpact of the Complex?\nReading the Robert Morris report leads to a growing realization: This\nreport about economic impact describes an accounting exercise, not an\napplication of economics. The impressive technique of input-output\nmodeling won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1973 for Wassily\nLeontief (Leontief 1936,\n@leontief1966), an economist who developed theory and methods\n(“The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic\nSciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1973,” n.d.) that\nbecame computationally tractable with the advent of high-speed\ncomputing. Setting this impressive methodological accolade aside, the\nchief difficulty with the Robert Morris report – and many other reports\nrelying on IMPLAN – is that it assembles a brief of benefits while\nignoring costs, the assembly of which is key feature of economic\nanalysis.\nThe John Locke Foundation is a firm critic of common input-output\nmodeling applications. The Foundation claimed (“Economic Impact Studies: The Missing\nIngredient Is Economics” 2017) that many input-output\nmodeling efforts are heavy on accounting, but light on economics. In\nfact, many studies using input-output analysis consider only benefits of\na project, but fail to consider or model any costs of a\nproject. In this way, many technically complicated studies of economic\nimpact represent attempts to advocate a project, not to research full\nimpact, even though sophisticated research tools are applied. The\nsophistication of the research tools used can cast a patina of economic\nscience over an analysis of only a portion of the components of a\nproblem studied.\nOf course, any new economic activity viewed without costs\nconsistently will demonstrate unalloyed benefits. Something is larger\nthan nothing, right? The “big-benefits-with-few-costs” approach is\ncompelling to legislators, policy-makers, and funding agencies seeking\nto convince the public that projects, events, or changes are\nindispensable for economic growth and community revitalization (Sanders 2015).\nThe John Locke Foundation observed that input-output modeling is\noften conducted “by professional consulting firms that interest groups\nhire to do the studies. Furthermore, those who perform the studies\nseldom have formal training in economics. Instead their expertise is in\nusing…proprietary [input-output] models (“Economic Impact Studies: The Missing\nIngredient Is Economics” 2017)”. I am not asserting by\nquoting this sentiment from the John Locke Foundation that the authors\nof the Robert Morris report lacked training and expertise in economics.\nTheir biographies reveal that they are seasoned economic analysts.\nInstead, I believe that the Robert Morris report represents an assertion\nof benefits without factoring in costs.\nIgnoring costs and other modes of failure to think ahead to consider\nfull economic consequences prompted Frédéric Bastiat, French economist\nbest known for his journalistic writing in favor of free trade and the\neconomics of Adam Smith, to write in his last published pamphlet in 1850\nthat:\n\nIn the economic sphere an act, a habit, an institution, a law\nproduces not only one effect, but a series of effects. Of these effects,\nthe first alone is immediate; it appears simultaneously with its cause;\nit is seen. The other effects emerge only subsequently; they are not\nseen; we are fortunate if we foresee them.\n\n\nThere is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one:\nthe bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good\neconomist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those\neffects that must be foreseen. (Bastiat 1964)\n\nAttributing\nResponsibility for Assessing Potential Impact\nI wish to attribute responsibility to the political and government\nrepresentatives of Pennsylvania citizens, not to Shell or the authors of\nthe Robert Morris report, for failing to exert due diligence over the\nevidence necessary to decide to expend tax revenue to support the\noperation of the Complex. The problem created by this failure probably\noutweighs any technical issues that might exist in the Robert Morris\nreport.\nI emphasize that Shell and the authors of the Robert Morris report\nwere not compelled to offer a report that would include costs estimates\nas well as benefits for the citizens of Pennsylvania and their\nrepresentatives. The problems, again, lie in the lack of due diligence\nby Commonwealth representatives. Instead, I suggest that the\nCommonwealth should have sought, either through a Commonwealth analysis\nor from an independent contractor, a report that displayed for the\npublic the costs along with the benefits before expending tax revenue to\npartner with a private enterprise investment.\nNo evidence is available that public representatives of the\nCommonwealth’s citizens made their own independent assessment of the\nregional economic impact of the Complex. Instead, they accepted, mostly\nuncritically, the economic impact estimates and forecasts prepared for\nShell and by other petrochemical industry associations to make their\ndecisions about tax expenditures for the Complex.\nTo be sure, Shell did not pretend to support an economic impact\nreport to meet the public’s needs for information. I can find nowhere in\nthe report or in Shell’s public statements that the report was intended\nto thoroughly inventory the costs and benefits of building and operating\nthe Complex for the public. As a private enterprise with shareholders\nshould be, Shell focused on its own interests. We should not conflate\nShell’s interests with the public interest. I do not make that assertion\ncynically but just observe that firms like Shell pursue free-market\nself-interest. Every stakeholder in these transactions needs to look\nafter its own interests. Who was looking after the interests of\nPennsylvania citizens?\nModeling efforts that produce analyses like those reported by the\nRobert Morris authors often run into discrepancies between the data\nneeded and the data available for analysis. IMPLAN and other\ninput-output modeling tools rely heavily on government data about\neconomic activity. Governments usually release data not about firms but\nare agglomerated from private data provided by firms into clusters of\ninformation in categories that do not identify firms. Sometimes this\ndiscrepancy between what analysts want and need requires compromises,\nfitting a few square pegs in round holes and getting a result “near to\nthe truth.”\nConstruction of a statement of the regional economic benefits of the\nComplex required many assumptions, analysis decisions, and compromises.\nI do not know the terms of Shell’s support for the Robert Morris report,\nbut I suppose that the Robert Morris authors produced a technical report\nthat satisfied Shell’s interests. The authors do not assert that the\nreport is meant to serve the public’s interest. The report is not\ndesigned primarily to serve the entire interests of Commonwealth\ncitizens.\nI assess that the Robert Morris authors of the report handled well\nmany technical constraints imposed by input-output modeling with IMPLAN\nand limitations levied by the regional data they analyzed. The report\nshows evidence of deft craftsmanship in conducting input-output analysis\nwith IMPLAN. The authors seem well-qualified in education and experience\nto tackle this impact analysis. I base my assessment on my approximately\n45 years of experience with input-output modeling and IMPLAN software,\nduring which I completed about 130 economic impact studies.\nBut perhaps the most striking realization about the reception of the\nRobert Morris report and the American Chemical Society’s reports is that\nthe Commonwealth did not feel the need to commission its own analysis of\nthe potential economic impact of the Complex. The Robert Morris report\nand the American Chemical Society’s seemed sufficient to satisfy public\nrepresentatives and officials that making tax expenditures on the\nComplex serves the public’s interests.\nThree Issues\nEvident in the Robert Morris Report\nI identify and discuss three issues evident in the Robert Morris\nreport. These issues mostly evolve from technical matters that I believe\naffect the validity of the report to inform the public about the\npotential regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex. I focus on these issues because the Robert Morris report seems\nto be the only recent evidence of the potential economic impact that\nreinforced public decision-making to expend tax revenue on the\nComplex.\nI am not under the illusion that identifying these three issues with\nthe Robert Morris report changes anything. The Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex will spin up soon. The chemistry will cook. The\nplastic resin will be nibbled into nurdles. Pointing out technical\nmatters about an economic impact report has little critical standing\nnext to what appears to be a significant lapse of fiduciary duty by\nelected and appointed public officials meant to represent Pennsylvania\ncitizens. Pennsylvania taxpayers became unwitting investors in a\nproject, the Complex, for which the social costs were neither organized\nnor delineated by their representatives, who allowed the entity seeking\nthe investment to define the project’s social benefits.\nClassification\nof the Industry Accounting for Impact\nThe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is classified in the\n“Petroleum Refineries” industry in the Robert Morris report.\nI argue that, because the primary product of the Complex is\npolyethylene pellets, output from the Complex probably is best\nclassified within the “Plastic Resin Manufacturing”\nindustry. Differences in the classification of the\nindustry in which the Complex is classified are important because data\nfrom a different industry likely would yield different impact estimates.\nIMPLAN notes that, although some industries are comparable, “each IMPLAN\nIndustry has its own production function and spending patterns” (Clouse, n.d.c, para. 4).\nThe\nComplex Extrudes Plastic Resin; It is Not a Refinery\nAbstracting from Figure 5, the flow between the\nethane cracking process to the polymerization is shown in Figure\n17. Ethylene is generated by cracking ethane at the\nComplex and becomes an input for polymerization. Ethylene is not an\noutput of the Complex for sale to customers. Polymerized plastic pellets\nform the major output, the major product, of the Complex. Analysis of\nthe Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex as a petroleum refinery is an\nerror. One more time for the folks in the back pews: The\nComplex sells polymerized plastic pellets from ethylene made at the\ncomplex. Ethylene made at the Complex is not a product of the Complex.\nIt is an input to another process at the Complex.\nConsider. You own a company that makes cans of noodles and meatballs\nin a tomato sauce. The company makes a lot of tomato sauce by processing\ntomatoes. Tomatoes are not the product. Tomatoes are one input to the\nproduct. Your company makes meatballs using meat purchased from an\nabattoir. Meatballs are not the product. They are an input to the\nproduct. The company cooks noodles made on site. Noodles are not the\nproduct. Noodles are an input to the product. When mixed and canned,\ntomato sauce, meatballs, and noodles form the final product your company\nsells to consumers. Your company is not a tomato sauce, meatball, or\nnoodle manufacturer. Your company sells cans of spaghetti and meatballs\nin tomato sauce to wholesalers as a processed food product. The\nwholesalers distribute the canned product to a retailer. A mama might\nbuy a can to put in her son’s thermos for a school lunch. You are in the\nSpaghetti Canning industry, not in a tomato, meatball, or noodle\nindustry.\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Ethylene is Generated at the Complex as an Input\nfor Polymerization.  Ethylene is not an output for Sale to\nCustomers.  Polymerized Plastic Pellets Form the Major Output of the\nComplex.  (Graphic drawn by David Passmore using DiagrammeR\npackage in RStudios.)\n\n\n\nThe\nAuthors of the Robert Morris Report Faced Analytic Compromises\nThe authors of the Robert Morris report had to shoehorn their\nanalytic problem into the IMPLAN framework. Here is the compromise\nrequired to select the Petroleum Refineries industry analyzed by Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark\n(2021b)\nrather than Petrochemical Manufacturing:\n\n“Within the IMPLAN application model, the ‘event’ selected for the\noperations phase of the economic impact is category number 154,\n‘Petroleum Refiners’….While the [IMPLAN] dataset includes a\nclassification for 159 Petrochemical Manufacturing, there is no\nmultiplier and no underlying data to model the economic impact on since\nthere is currently no such activity within the state of Pennsylvania.\nTherefore, the nearest analogous industry and multiplier to the previous\nstudy, Petroleum Refineries, was selected. (p. 8-9)\n\nThis attempt to get the best fit of available government income and\nproduct accounting data with the IMPLAN application is a common\ncompromise that required professional judgment by the authors of the\nRobert Morris report. IMPLAN contains 546 industries for analysis\nagglomerated from thousands of industry categories from which federal\nstatistical agencies obtain and classify data using the North American\nIndustry Classification System (NAICS).\nClassified by NAICS are establishments by the primary goods or\nservices they produce (“What Is the NAICS\nStructure and How Many Digits Are in a NAICS Code?”\nn.d.). The “North American Industry Classification\nSystem (NAICS) u.s. Census Bureau” (n.d.) says, “Economic units that have\nsimilar production processes are classified in the same industry, and\nthe lines drawn between industries demarcate, to the extent practicable,\ndifferences in production processes” (p. 3). Almost all statistics\ncaptured about economic activity by the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, and other government agencies are classified by NAICS\ncodes. According to an online FAQ about the NAICS coding system (“North American Industry Classification\nSystem (NAICS) u.s. Census Bureau,” n.d.):\n\nNAICS is a 2– through 6–digit hierarchical classification system,\noffering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a\nseries of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in the\ncode signify greater classification detail. The first two digits\ndesignate the economic sector, the third digit designates the subsector,\nthe fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit\ndesignates the NAICS industry, and the sixth digit designates the\nnational industry. The 5–digit NAICS code is the level at which there is\ncomparability in code and definitions for most of the NAICS sectors\nacross the three countries participating in NAICS (the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico). The 6–digit level allows for the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico each to have country-specific detail. A complete and\nvalid NAICS code contains six digits.\n\nUnder NAICS, an industry is comprised of a group of establishments\nengaged in the same or similar types of economic activity. An\nestablishment is a single location where business is conducted or where\nservices/operations are performed.20 Generally, accounting\nfor the production flow moves from establishments within firms and then\nis aggregated to industries.\nIndustry output is produced by firms, which are for-profit business\norganizations, such as a corporations, limited liability companies, or\npartnership. Many firms can contribute to an industry. Industries are\nnot mutually exclusive collections of firms. Different industries might\ninclude some of the same firms. Also, firms might own or manage multiple\nestablishments at which industry production occurs.\nClassifying an establishment under more than one NAICS code is\npossible if the establishment makes more than one product. For instance,\nat one time, Kodak made cameras, but the firm also produced chemicals.\nIn this way, an industry does not hold firms inclusively within a single\nNAICS code, and single NAICS codes do not classify firms\nexclusively.\nIMPLAN provides a crosswalk between their 546-industry\nclassifications and NAICS codes (a spreadsheet at IMPLAN (n.d.) contains the crosswalk). Many\nthousands more NAICS codes exist than IMPLAN industry classifications.\nAs a result, each IMPLAN industry represents a large cluster of NAICS\nindustries. Inspection and comparison of the many NAICS CODE associated\nwith IMPLAN industry 154, Petroleum Refineries, and IMPLAN industry 159,\nPetrochemical Manufacturing, reveals that IMPLAN’s Petroleum Refineries\nindustry (IMPLAN 154) does not point to any ethylene production.\nDescriptions of NAICS industries under Petrochemical Manufacturing\ninclude products made from natural gas liquids such as ethane. However,\nthe authors of the Robert Morris report selected IMPLAN 154, Petroleum\nRefineries, for analysis, even though it is not a good match for the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, for these reasons:\n\nWhile the dataset [for IMPLAN] includes a classification for 159\nPetrochemical Manufacturing, there is no multiplier and no underlying\ndata to model the economic impact on since there is currently no such\nactivity within the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, the nearest\nanalogous industry and multiplier to the previous study, Petroleum\nRefineries, was selected. (Clinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark 2021g,\n8–9)\n\nClassifying\nthe Complex in the Petroleum Refineries Industry is an Error\nSubstitution of available data about petroleum refineries for\nunavailable data about plastic resin manufacturing from hydrocarbons\n(including ethylene production) is an error. NAICS definitions of these\nindustries show that these two industries are different:\nNAICS 324110, Petroleum Refineries, “comprises\nestablishments primarily engaged in refining crude petroleum into\nrefined petroleum. Petroleum refining involves one or more of the\nfollowing activities: (1) fractionation; (2) straight distillation of\ncrude oil; and (3) cracking” (“Definition of 324110 Petroleum Refineries,\n2017,” n.d.).\nNAICS 325110, Plastic Material and Resin Manufacturing,\n“comprises establishments primarily engaged in (1) manufacturing acyclic\n(i.e., aliphatic) hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene\nmade from refined petroleum or liquid hydrocarbons and/or (2)\nmanufacturing cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene,\npolystyrene, ethylene, ethyl benzene, and acumen made from refined\npetroleum or liquid hydrocarbons” (“Definition of 325110 Plastic Resin\nManufacturing, 2017,” n.d.).\nCracking is, indeed, part of NAICS 324110. However, NAICS codes\ndefine industries in which a product is manufactured for other\nindustries (what is called “intermediate production”) or sold directly\nfor personal consumption, business investment, government purchases, and\nexports (what is called “final demand”). The Pennsylvania Petrochemical\nComplex does not sell its cracked ethane to other firms. It does not\nsell ethylene to fulfill final demand in the economy. Instead, the\nethylene made at the Complex is transferred within the complex to the\nnext and final step in the production flow of the Complex – for plastic\nresin production.\nA practical argument often is made in IMPLAN analyses that using a\nproxy industry deemed close in structure and production to a target\nindustry is a practical solution to this classification problem and is\nall that seems possible within the data limitations. Yet, in the case of\nthe Complex, the proxy and target industries not only are quite\ndifferent in products, but the proxy and the target industries employ\ndifferent processes and draw in different patterns of resources.\nFor just one example of the difference between the proxy and target\nindustries for the Robert Morris report, using national data from the\nU.S. Census Bureau for 2020 (U. S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics 2021), NAICS 324110, Petroleum\nRefineries, generated $7.2 million of output per worker, while NAICS\n325110, Plastic Resin Manufacturing, produced $2.1 million of output per\nworker. These values are crude measures that do not reflect official\nproductivity statistics and probably are inappropriate guides to output\nper worker in the Pennsylvania economy and that are anticipated from the\nComplex. However, if the output per worker in the proxy industry\nanalyzed in the Robert Morris report is 3.4 times the value for the\ntarget industry. If this difference in scale is valid, then the Robert\nMorris report contains inflated estimates of value added, labor income,\nand taxes.21\nComplex Analytic\nAlternatives Were Possible\nThe authors of the Robert Morris report had analytic options beyond\nusing a proxy industry for the target industry. The IMPLAN database can\nbe customized by adding an industry that does not exist yet or using a\nproxy region similar to the region of interest (Lucas,\nn.d.). Also possible is adding a new industry to a region by\nspecifying a spending pattern for the new industry (Clouse, n.d.a). To follow these options,\nan analyst would require financial data about the Complex’s output and\nsupply structure, which Shell, I am sure, would like to keep\nconfidential.\nIdentification\nof Indirect and Induced Impacts\nPlastic resin manufacturing will directly support jobs at the Complex\nthat pay wages to workers and extract wage taxes for governments. Also,\nthe Complex will purchase goods and services from suppliers, which will\nindirectly multiply business value, income, jobs, and taxes beyond the\nComplex. In addition, pay received by workers in the Complex and by\nworkers in the firms that supply the Complex will induce consumer goods\nand services purchases. The direct, indirect, and induced\nimpacts of “plastic resin manufacturing” differ from impacts that could\nbe created by “petroleum refining.” This issue is a\ncorollary to the first issue that I identified – the industry in which\nthe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is misidentified as “Petroleum\nRefineries.”\nThe Complex will purchase non-durable goods and services from\nsuppliers. I believe that Complex is likely to have a unique production\nfunction – that is, the recipe of inputs necessary to produce the output\nof the Complex. Ethane cracking will co-locate with resin production,\nprobably reducing the costs incurred by a facility that must purchase\nethylene externally for delivery. Pipeline or container transportation\nrequires extra expenses for cryogenic containers or pipelines under high\npressure to keep ethylene in a dense fluid state rather than as a vapor.\nThe Complex will generate, rather than purchase, its own electricity.\nShell has indicated how much natural gas it will purchase through the\nFalcon Pipeline and how much water it might use, but the amount and kind\nof other inputs to the Complex remain unknown. Also unknown is the\nproportion of inputs Shell will purchase locally in Beaver County or the\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania region.\nBecause neither the production function for the Complex nor the\nproportion of inputs satisfied locally are known, the indirect economic\nimpact of the Complex is not clear. As a result, the potential exists\nfor over- or under-statement of the total economic impact of the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Also, if the primary product of the\nComplex is, as I assert, best classified as plastic resin, not ethylene,\nthen misspecification of the full economic impact of the Complex shown\nin the Robert Morris report is possible.\nQuestionable\nValidity of a 40-Year Forecast of Impact\nForecasted in the Robert Morris report is the potential 40-year\neconomic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.22 IMPLAN, the developer of software\napplied to produce the Robert Morris report, cautions against long-term\nforecasting due to various limitations of the static input-output model\nprogrammed by IMPLAN in representing the dynamics operating over time in\nthe working economy (Data Team 2022, “Why\nIsn’t There Any Forecasting”).\nI conclude that these 40-year estimates of impact\nconstitute an extension of static input-output modeling, software, and\ndata beyond their limitations. The economy of even a small\nregion is constantly in flux and does not remain static, especially over\na 40-year future period. IMPLAN notes that\n\n“To make a projection of what the economy will look [requires\nprediction] of all the demands for consumption…and [to] know all the new\ncommodities and technologies that will be available. Local availability\nof resources to meet that demand would also need to be known.” (Data Team 2022, “Why Isn’t There Any\nForecasting”)\n\nAbsolute and relative prices remain static in IMPLAN’s equations,\nalthough dynamic prices are part of natural economic change – especially\nwhen considered over a 40-year forecast period. Also assumed in IMPLAN\nis that the technology to produce an industry’s output will not change,\na fanciful notion about the future of modern production processes. The\n40-year forecasts of economic impact displayed in the Robert Morris\nreport were prominent in public discussion of the Complex in the popular\nand environmental press. The forecasts attempt to portray the\nsustainable impact of the Complex. The economic model and data were not\ndesigned or suitable for long-term economic forecasting.\nNext Steps\nLast, I describe briefly ways that remain for documenting the full\nregional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.\nThese ways do not include replicating the Robert Morris report after the\nComplex starts operations. The Robert Morris report is filed. Shell’s\nship already has sailed. Barring any significant impediments, the\nComplex will open. And, for right or wrong, the Commonwealth has\ncodified its commitment to investment in the Complex through\nlegislation. Everything is moving forward.\nTime to look forward to using available or new data to attribute\nregional economic changes to the emerging activity of the Complex.\nEspecially critical will be efforts to incorporate measures of the\nsocial costs of the Complex into any future assessment.\nFollow the Data\nEric de Place, a research fellow at the Ohio River Valley Institute,\nurged in a 2021 interview, “As the cracker facility opens, and as it\nshifts to actually producing polyethylene, let’s continue to look back\nat the track record on the ground and compare it to the promises and see\nwhether economic growth happens or not” (Scott 2021, para. 8). This assessment\ncould be structured around regional economic data before and after the\nstart-up of the Complex and on a comparison with comparable economic\nregions without an ethane cracker. A necessity will be to draw on\ninnovations in the creative and complex design of natural experiments23 to make these comparisons valid and\nfair. As far as I know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform such\nan assessment.\nWeigh\nCosts, Especially of By-Products, as Well as Benefits\nAny future assessment of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex’s\neconomic impact should include costs, not just benefits. In\nparticular, such an assessment should calculate the cost of by-products\nfrom the Complex. Again, a by-product is a material produced as a\nresidual of, or incidental to, the production process. In an accounting\nsense, by-products are associated with costs, not revenue. The Environmental Law Institute\n(2018) and Doyle (n.d.) identified by-products of the\nComplex that are considered hazardous by the World Health Organization,\nthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and other agencies.\nRecent reviews of research by Aguilar-Gomez et al. (2022)\nhighlighted the substantial costs of pollution in terms of health,\nworker productivity, crime, and decision-making from outdoor (Aguilar-Gomez et al.\n2022), indoor (Duflo, Greenstone, and Hanna 2008), and\nwater (Schwarzenbach et al.\n2010) sources even though remarkable improvements in\nenvironmental quality have occurred in the U.S. over several decades\n(J. Currie and Walker, n.d.).\nNevertheless, low-income and minority households often are concentrated\nin more highly polluted regions and, consequently, suffer higher rates\nof age- and cause-specific morbidity and mortality (Janet Currie, Voorheis, and Walker\n2020).\nSome public statements about the Complex tend to separate the\neconomic impact of the Complex from concerns about the effects of its\nby-products on public health as though the two realms of evidence are\nrelated only by topic. The Complex often is discussed in fiscal terms.\nHowever, significant by-products of the Complex often are addressed in\nthe language of epidemiology, medicine, and biostatistics. This\nseparation downgrades the perceived financial and economic consequences\nof hazardous by-products, especially those by-products rarely seen or\nsmelled.24 Some synthesis of these approaches\nis desirable in future assessments of the Complex. The concepts and\ntools of economic analysis might present a path for this synthesis.\nAccount\nfor By-Products as Potential Negative Externalities\nIdentifying by-products as externalities, a concept used in\neconomics, is a common way to account for their impact. An externality\nexists when producing or consuming a good cause an impact on third\nparties not directly involved in the production or consumption\ntransaction. Externalities are classified as either positive or\nnegative. A negative externality results in costs that are not paid by\nthe producer or consumer but rather by a third party.\nThe Complex could create negative externalities by cracking ethane\nand making plastic resin that, incidental to the process, could\ncompromise the health of third-party Pennsylvania citizens and damage\nthe greater Pittsburgh environment. One response to negative\nexternalities is to charge fees for production permits that are high\nenough to cover the expected lifetime costs created by the externality.\nThe Complex obtains permits for the Commonwealth’s Department of\nEnvironmental for specific amounts and kinds of emissions or discharges.\nUnknown is whether these fees cover the total costs of\nexternalities.\nMore problem-focused than permit fees is the use of so-called\n“cap-and-trade” government regulatory programs designed to limit, or\ncap, the total level of emissions of certain chemicals, particularly\ncarbon dioxide (“How Cap and Trade\nWorks,” n.d.). Firms that surpass the cap are taxed,\nwhile companies that cut their emissions may sell or trade unused\ncredits. In April 2022, Pennsylvania entered the Regional Greenhouse Gas\nInitiative, a controversial multistate cap-and-trade program to reduce\nCO2, but only affecting electric power plants (see 25\nPA. CODE CH. 145). Some criticisms of cap-and-trade programs involve\nassertions that, on the one hand, the cap on emission usually is set too\nhigh and that, on the other hand, the program eliminates jobs (McDevitt 2020). I am not aware of any\nplans to integrate the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex into a\ncap-and-trade framework.\nAnother approach is to collect a “Pigouvian” tax25\nthat pays for the consequences of the negative externality on\nindependent third parties and can dampen the manufacture of a good\ngenerating the externality by raising the cost of its production.\nPigouvian taxes shift the costs from society back to the producers of\nthese externalities. The aim, also, is to eliminate market distortions\nof artificially low production costs caused by passing some costs along\nto an innocent third party, often the public. Without a way of\naccounting for externalities associated with the Complex, costs are\n“kicked down the road” to future generations of Pennsylvanians. A\nfamiliar outcome to many Pennsylvania citizens and regional governments,\nisn’t it, in the history of Pennsylvania fossil fuel development and\nproduction?\nThe amount of the Pigouvian tax should equal the cost of the harmful\nexternality, but calculating these costs is complex and nearly\nimpossible with any precision. I certainly realize, though, that the\ntotal costs of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will prove\nchallenging to estimate. Even so, any estimate of the full economic\nimpact of the Complex should include public, social costs, especially\ncosts imposed from by-products.\nMeasuring the public, social costs of the Complex are prerequisites\nto, even if difficult to measure, additional regulation and permitting,\na cap-and-trade approach, or establishing a Pigouvian tax to limit or\ncompensate for any externalities the Complex will generate. Even if\nthese three approaches prove impractical, some method for dealing with\nnegative externalities is necessary.\nMy Brief Sermon as a\nPostscript\nI hope that this blog posting serves as a cautionary tale about how\ngovernments review of proposals for the use of public monies to\nsubsidize innovation by private enterprises. The case for public\nsubsidies often rests solely on the perception of the economic benefits\nof the innovation to the public. But, proposals touting benefits only\npresent merely a one-sided argument. Seldom identified and analyzed are\nthe total costs, risks, and uncertainties that the public must bear when\ndeciding to expend current or potential tax revenue.\nConsider how peculiar the request is to allocate public funds for\nprivate innovation. Rarely are major financial decisions made by\nbusinesses without balancing the benefits of innovation or change\nagainst its costs. Similarly, the investment of public funds in private\ninnovation is a significant financial decision made by elected and\nappointed public representatives. Yet, decisions to use public funds for\nprivate innovation often do not undergo the same financial scrutiny\ninvoked by businesses.\nWould a business make an investment decision without perpending costs\nas well as benefits? Failure of a business to calculate a set of full\npros and cons of a financial proposition – what Benjamin Franklin\ndescribed as calculating a moral or prudential algebra26 –\nmight result in charges of financial malpractice. Shareholders of\nprivate enterprises would take a dim view of willy-nilly investments\nbased on benefits without considering costs. So, why shouldn’t the\npublic demand a similar benefit/cost calculus in any transaction made by\na government that expends scarce tax revenue gathered in trust from\ncitizens? Where is the due diligence for the Commonwealth’s citizens if\nevidence solely about benefits, absent costs, of public investment is\npitched only by the anticipated recipients of public funds?\nBusinesses in market economies act to accomplish what is best for\ntheir shareholders. Fiercely minimizing costs…profit by generating\ngreater revenue from operations than expenses…maximizing shareholder\nvalue. Commonwealth citizens also have the right to expect that their\nrepresentatives follow their fiduciary duty to always act with the\npublic’s best interests in mind. The Commonwealth manages tax\nexpenditures to profit the welfare of its citizens. Tax expenditures by\nthe Commonwealth should yield a stream of benefits for citizens that at\nleast equals expenditures. Without these motivations, neither businesses\nnor governments are feasible and ultimately sustainable.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-06-28 13:51:19 EDT\"\n\nMy Point of View\nI do not mean this blog posting to advocate or denounce, take a\nposition pro or con about, the Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex, although my narrative in this posting carries a\ncritical and evaluative tone. Instead, I wrote this blog posting to\ndocument and clarify the meanings I attached to the political (somewhat)\nand economic (more so) history, status, and future of the Complex.\nWriting this blog posting was essential to me because, as E. M. Forster,\nEnglish fiction writer, essayist, and librettist, reputedly once wrote,\n“How do I know what I think until I see what I say?”\nI certainly tried to keep you in mind, dear reader, as I composed\nthis blog posting. However, my primary motivation behind this posting\nwas selfishly on my own learning. If this blog posting had been written\nwith readers as my primary audience, it would have been tighter,\ncontained fewer asides, and eschewed deep and turgid cul-de-sacs of\nvocabulary and argument. But I wrote it for myself. Therefore, I did not\nfeel constrained to reduce my word count, to “get to the point” quicker,\nor to genuflect toward de rigeur authors and their arguments\nbullying us as I might if I had been forced to write for an academic\njournal while in a state of dread anticipating the pontificating,\npointy, and deadly attacks from a demonic “reviewer #2” (Guillet 2020).\nSo, there you have it. Like Bill Belichick, New England Patriots head\ncoach and general manager, often tells reporters, “It is what it is.” My\nride. I just picked you up as a hitcher.\nAcknowledgements\nConsultation is acknowledged gratefully about blogging technicalities\nand graphics creation from Chungil Chae, assistant professor in the\nDepartment of Management, Marketing and International Business, College\nof Business and Public Management, Wenzhou-Kean University, Wenzhou,\nZhejiang Province, China.

The authors of the report confirmed that their report\nwas withheld “on the grounds that it only released the full study to\nentities with a commercial interest” (Sanzillo and Hipple 2020b, 3).↩︎\nRead my manifesto, My Point of\nView, in an appendix to this posting for a brief statement of my\nmotivations and approach to writing about the economic impact of the\nPennsylvania Petrochemical Complex.↩︎\nThe public record about each of these\nthree threads is thin. Information about the markets for products\nexpected from the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex often sits behind\npaywalls. Little is known about negotiations between Shell and\nCommonwealth officials for public support of the Complex, except for\nsnippets of revelations made in public comments documented in the\npopular press. Potential regional economic impacts of the Complex were\nasserted through industry-sponsored reports, which were echoed seemingly\nuncritically by Commonwealth officials. There seems to have been a\nsparse independent response to these reports. My understanding of the\noperations of the Complex was informed to some extent by public\nInternet-accessible documents about ethane cracking and polymerization,\nbut primarily from a single application Shell submitted for air quality\napproval. For the most part, however, important details are unknown to\nme about the workings of the Complex that dictate its supply chain and\naffect its outputs of products, co-product, and by-products. My\ndiscussion of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in this blog\nposting resulted from looking at shadows on the wall rather than direct,\nfirst-person observation of events, transactions, and decisions made by\nShell and Commonwealth officials. I dealt with what was available to\nme.↩︎\nAnd, my own calculation. So quite\nunofficial.↩︎\nAlthough writers for the World Bank\nhave indicated that “cost per job may not be the right indicator in\nmeasuring job creation policies, but rather the social rate of return\nassociated with the intervention” (Rabalino 2018).↩︎\nThe American Chemistry Council\ndefines itself as “America’s oldest trade association of its kind,\nrepresenting more than 190 companies engaged in the business of\nchemistry – an innovative, economic growth engine that is helping to\nsolve the biggest challenges facing our country and the world. Our\nmembers are the leading companies engaged in all aspects of the business\nof chemistry, from the largest corporations to the smallest, and\neverything in between” (“About ACC,”\nn.d.).↩︎\nSix in operation, while a seventh\nundergoes maintenance.↩︎\nSome of the information I present\nabout the operation of the Complex is due to general, publicly-available\ndescriptions of ethane cracking and polymerization. However, for\nspecific information about the Complex I relied on Shell’s air quality\napproval\napplication to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014a), which I treated as\nauthoritative, Shell-vetted and -sanctioned details about the Complex.↩︎\nThe document, Air Quality Plan\nApproval Application: Petrochemicals Complex, Shell Chemical Appalachia\nLLC, Beaver County, Pennsylvania (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b), is the best source of\ninformation I have found about the processes applied and emissions of\nthe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Therefore I cite this\napplication frequently in this blog posting. The application is Shell’s\nofficial description of the Complex offered to the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Environmental Protection. The Department issued a permit\nin 2015 (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 2015),\nwhich was valid through 2019. I am not aware of a renewal of this permit\nand any process or emission updates that a renewal application might\ncite.↩︎\nA a type of chemical bond in which\ntwo electron pairs are shared between two atoms (Helmenstine, n.d.a).↩︎\nI uncovered only a graphic described\nas a “generalized graphic” that indicated that liquefied ethylene is a\npossible co-product for export from an ethane cracker (“Petrochem Peril: Bill Peduto 2019,”\nn.d.). Although the graphic does not seem to have been\ndesigned to describe the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex in\nparticular, it was re-purposed and applied to indicate the probable\nplant/process layout of the Complex. Shell’s Air Quality Plan\nApproval Application (RTP\nEnvironmental Associates, Inc. 2014b) does not identify\nliquefied ethylene as a product of the Complex.↩︎\nMore technically, is an\nexothermic reaction.↩︎\nAgain, co-products are goods or\nservices produced incidental to main production that have market value\nto generate revenue. A by-product is a material produced as a residual\nof, or incidental to, the production process. In an accounting sense,\nby-products are associated with costs.↩︎\nReported to me was that a new permit\nis required when the Complex begins operating.↩︎\nSanzillo and Hipple (2020d)\nreported that Robert Morris University professors completed an earlier\nreport for Shell in 2014. Shell informed them “that the report is not\n‘externally available’ (p. 4),” even though the unreleased report was\nquoted extensively by independent media sources. Sanzillo and Hipple (2020d)\nconcluded that “The company has clearly decided not to disclose basic\ninformation about its project—not even how much the plant will cost\n(p. 4).”↩︎\nI will refer in the remainder of\nthis blog posting to the report, Updated Economic Impact Analysis:\nPetrochemical Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, as the\n“Robert Morris report.” In making this assignment, I realize that I\nmight promote the error of conflating the personal work of a team of\nprofessors with the official position of Robert Morris University. In\n1940, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), affirmed\nthe “free search for truth and its free exposition” (“1940 Statement of Principles on Academic\nFreedom and Tenure” 2006, para. 1) of faculty\nresearchers. Faculty research findings are not necessarily university\nconclusions. As this independence of expression is executed, the AAUP\nenjoined faculty researchers that they “should be accurate at all times”\n(“1940 Statement of\nPrinciples on Academic Freedom and Tenure” 2006, item 3 in\n“Academic Freedom”). I am not suggesting that the authors of the\nRobert Morris report hid behind an often-assumed cloak of endorsement\nfrom Robert Morris University itself or that their work was not\naccurate. Rather, my point is to separate Robert Morris University as a\nlocus for this research from the methods chosen by the researchers and\nthe findings they reached. The blending of the aims and conclusions of\nresearchers with their employing institutions is common in discussion of\nthe potential economic impact of Pennsylvania natural gas development\nand production. Rose Baker and I discussed problems created by referring\nto forecasts funded by the Marcellus Shale Coalition of the economic\nimpact of Pennsylvania natural gas development and production as the\n“Penn State studies” (Passmore 2011).↩︎\nThe Robert Morris report is the\nresult of independent work by its authors, not by Shell. Front matter in\nthe report underscores not only the independence of the authors, but\nalso the separation of the report from Shell: “All work contained in\nthis study expresses only the opinion of the authors and is the result\nof publicly available information. The results and conclusions are those\nof the authors, not those of Royal Dutch Shell plc or any of its\naffiliates (Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021c, iii).” The report does not rise to the level\nof a what Shell describes as “forward-looking statement” (“Shell Takes Final Investment Decision to\nBuild a New Petrochemicals Complex in Pennsylvania, US,”\nn.d.b, “Cautionary Note”) about its plans and operations.↩︎\nClinton, Minutolo, and O’Roark (2021b) reported\nthat “Additionally, we specify the Multiple Region Input-Output (MRIO)\nmodel which recognizes the spillover effects across the regions of\nstudy” (p.10). If the MRIO model was used, the way that it was specified\nand the results it produced are not clear in the report. IMPLAN\nindicates “In an MRIO analysis, the Direct Effect in one region can\ntrigger Indirect and Induced Effects in linked regions, thereby\naccounting for some of what would have been a leakage in a single-region\nanalysis. This lack of documentation of use of MRIO in the analysis\nleading to the report opens questions about whether the southwestern\nPennsylvania results were derived from separate analyses of the each of\nthe 10 counties with the starting point for Complex employment. IMPLAN\ncautions against what they describe as a”mock MRIO” by doing an analysis\nof “the same event occurring in a smaller region and in a larger region,\nlike a county and a state and then distributed the difference between\nthe two as the effects that would occur in the rest of the state (i.e.,\nthe state less the county in which the direct effect actually took\nplace). At best, this was a shaky methodology. However, since the\ndevelopment of domestic trade data and MRIO capabilities in 2008, this\nis no longer necessary and therefore is not an acceptable method!” (Slovachek, n.d.).↩︎\nMany IMPLAN modeling efforts begin\nby asking “what if a certain number of jobs are added in an industry?”\nAn alternative is to ask “what if the output of an industry increased by\na number of millions of dollars?” In input-output modeling. these two\napproaches are equivalent. Adding jobs adds output to the economy by the\ndollar value of the product produced by each added worker (i.e., labor\nproductivity). Adding output to the economy adds to number of jobs\nrequired to produce each dollar’s worth of output (i.e., labor\nintensity). Either way the modeling is initiated, adding output from an\nindustry to the economy pushes backward into the economy to require\npurchasing of additional supply from other industries and, in this way,\ngenerates additional jobs and income throughout the economy.↩︎\nIf employees normally do not work at\na single physical location, the establishment is identified by the main\noffice that supervises employees’ activities or is the base at which\nemployees carry out these activities.↩︎\nRefer to Table 2 to explore further\nwhat appears to be very high dollar of value added per direct worker.↩︎\nA 40-year span of life of the\nComplex might seem like a rather long period of plant service for which\nto estimate economic impact. Pearson (2010) concluded that the average life of\nethylene plants in North America and Europe will be around 30 years\nconsidering the anticipated effects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion,\ncarburization-oxidation, and possible critical plant failure, although\ninnovations could extend petrochemical and chemical plants well beyond\ntheir original anticipated design life. An important question is whether\nsustaining the Complex’s product and resource markets is possible for as\nlong as the infrastructure for the Complex is viable.↩︎\nAssessing the impact of the\noperation of the Complex is a complex technical problem in research\ndesign. Pre- and post-cracker comparisons of economic measures are\npossible. However, drawing causal connections between the ethane cracker\nintervention and pre- and post-operation states are complicated by the\nimpossibility of random assignment of ethane cracker operations and the\ncommon threats to the validity of before-and-after studies. So-called\n“quasi-experimental” research designs (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell, Donald\n2001) are best-suited to control these design problems. For\ninstance, interrupted time-series models (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2001, 175)\nof pre and post differences between the operation of the Complex are\npossible candidates for the Complex impact design. Propensity score\nadjustments (Austin 2011) are\npossible for making “fair” comparisons of economic growth in the\nlocation of the Complex with similar communities absent a petrochemical\noperation. More on this research design problem in subsequent blog\npostings.↩︎\nDavid Foster Wallace in This is\nWater tells a little didactic parable about how the most obvious\nand important realities are often those that are hardest to see: “There\nare these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an\nolder fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning,\nboys, how’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and\nthen eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the\nhell is water?’ (Wallace 2009,\n3–4).”↩︎\nA Pigouvian tax takes its name from\nArthur Pigou, the English economist who contributed to theory and\nunderstanding of externalities.↩︎\nSee a September 19, 1772 letter from\nFranklin to chemist Joseph Priestley (Franklin 1817). He advises Priestley to\nengage a moral or prudential algebra by listing the pros and cons of a\ndecision and reflecting on the alternatives over time before deciding.↩︎\n",

Maybe you have\nanswers for me. I am ignorant. Educate me, please! Share information\nwith me using the Disqus comment form at the bottom of this\nposting. Contact me privately with your answers or insights through a\ndirect message on Twitter @DLPPassmore or via email at\ndlp@davidpassmore.net.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Rendering of the Soon-To-Be-Completed Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex\n\n\n\nBut, first, a brief background statement about my simple, personal\nunderstanding of ethane cracking and pellet manufacturing at the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, an understanding that I encourage\nyou to dispute and suggest that I update. Then, I offer my questions.\nBored with the background already? Then, jump directly to the\nquestions.\nBrief Background\nNatural Gas Liquids\nObtaining methane for energy production is a primary focus of natural\ngas extraction from Marcellus Shale and Utica shale formations in the\nnortheastern U.S. Natural gas extracted in north central and northeast\nPennsylvania is described as “dry” because it contains mostly methane.\nHowever. so-called “wet” gas produced in southwestern Pennsylvania\ncontains methane, but also natural gas liquids (NGLs) such as ethane,\npropane, butane, isobutane, and pentane. These co-products1 of\nnatural gas production, while costly to separate from the natural gas\nstream, have commercial value to add profitability to the extraction of\nwet gas.\nEthane Cracking\nHistorically, most NGLs used in the U.S. have been recovered from\nU.S. natural gas, although some have been sourced from crude oil\nrefining and imports (Keller 2012).\nEthane represents the highest proportion of NGLs in wet gas. Ethane\ndistilled from natural gas liquids is a feedstock for ethylene\nproduction.\nEthylene is a raw material for the manufacture of polymers such as\npolyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polystyrene as well as fibers and\nother organic chemicals. A majority of ethylene is produced using a\nprocess called “steam cracking,” a thermal process in which\nhydrocarbons2 are broken down, or “cracked” into\nsmaller molecules.\nIn a few words,3 superheated, pressurized steam\ncauses ethane (C\\(_{2}\\)H\\(_{6}\\)) to vaporize, which splits the bonds\nbetween carbon and hydrogen atoms. Ethyelene molecules (H\\(_{2}\\)C⚌CH\\(_{2}\\)), form, freeing two hydrogen atoms.\nThe resulting vapor is composed of ethylene, other hydrocarbons,\nunprocessed ethane molecules, and steam.4 The\nvapor undergoes additional processing to isolate the ethylene\nmolecules.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Ethane Molecules are Cracked to Form Ethylene Molecules\n\n\n\nPolymerization\nUnique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single\nbonds chemically with up to four other atoms and to double bond with\nitself, as in an ethylene molecule. Carbon is one of the only elements,\nbecause of its bonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped\nmolecules to form the basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids\n(DNA and RNA), and proteins that serve as the basis of life itself.\nChaining together ethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical\nprocess called polymerization produces polyethylene (a polymer, which\nmeans “many parts”) with thermoplastic attributes. A thermoplastic has\nthe property of softening or fusing when heated and of hardening and\nbecoming rigid again when cooled.\nDownstream Uses of\nPolyethylene\nPolyethylene is the primary feedstock for manufacturing a vast range\nof consumer products, the foremost of which involve packaging (a few of\nmany examples: sandwich wrap, cling wrap, moisture barriers, food\npackaging, box coating). Polyethylene often is produced as small\npellets. These plastic pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in\ndownstream markets. Pellet prices demonstrate volatility (Pederson 2021) because they are driven\non the supply side by equally volatile prices for natural gas and on the\ndemand side by consumer preferences for “eco-friendly” packaging\nsolutions and by environmental regulation of plastic products.\nNotable Inputs\n& By-Products of Ethane Cracking\nSome Inputs\nAn ethane cracker gathers, usually through pipelines, a supply of\nethane feedstock that has been fractionated [“Fractionation - an Overview | ScienceDirect\nTopics” (n.d.)]5\nfrom the NGL spectrum in natural gas extracted from shale formations at\nwell sites. Markedly, ethylene production uses a large amount of energy\nto superheat the steam that cracks ethylene from ethane.\nSome By-Products\nCracking ethane emits hazardous by-products6\nthat can render the air, soil, water, or other natural resources harmful\nor unsuitable for use. Small inhalable particles (e.g., PM\\(_{2.5}\\)), another by-product of ethane\nproduction, can damage short- and long-term human respiratory function.\nCracking also releases carbon dioxide (CO\\(_{2}\\)), a gas that can absorb energy\nwithin the infrared wavelengths. This energy is transferred by collision\nwith other molecules. Faster molecular motion produces heat. Trapped\nheat from this action of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is the\n“greenhouse effect” that has affected global warming.\nThe Pennsylvania\nPetrochemical Complex\nShell7 made a final investment decision to\nbuild an ethane cracker integrated with a plastic pellet manufacturing\nfacility at the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex on the Ohio River in\nMonaca, Pennsylvania (“Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex,” n.d.). The plant (see Figure\n3) is nearing is nearing completion and could starting\noperating in late 2022, according to Shell announcements reported in the\npopular press (Melinek 2021).8 Shell has estimated variously the\ndeployment of between 400 to 600 jobs at the Complex.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Google Map of Location of Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex\n\n\n\nShell has indicated that the plant will produce 1.6 million tons of\nvarious grades of polyethylene pellets from 3.9 million barrels of\nethane annually. The ethane cracker is geographically proximal to ethane\nsources in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia involved with wet gas\nproduction and processing from Marcellus and Utica shale formations.9 More than 70% of North American\npolyethylene customers are within a 700-mile radius of plastic pellet\nproduction at the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex.\nAccording to a biting 2020 analysis offered by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial\nAnalysis (Sanzillo and Hipple\n2020), the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex faces prospects\nof low product prices, risk of oversupply of plastic resins, stiff\ncompetition from other producers, volatility in ethane feedstock\nmarkets, the possibility of low overall economic growth, and competition\nfrom recycled plastics materials. Concluded by the Institute is that the\nComplex “will open to market conditions that are more challenging than\nwhen the project was planned. The [C]omplex is likely to be less\nprofitable than expected and face an extended period of financial\ndistress.”\nSome of My Questions….You\nHave Answers?\nWhat Motivates My Questions?\nAs I wrote, I have many questions about the Pennsylvania\nPetrochemicals Complex. In particular, I remain largely ignorant of many\nof the deep, fundamental facts about the Complex. Perhaps, you feel this\nway, too.\nI believe I have answers to some questions, which I will share for\nyour scrutiny. Answers to many of my questions are extant, of course. I\nmerely have not discovered them. You can help by informing me about\naccessible documents that provide answers. And, perhaps you have new and\nimportant questions that I have not considered. Poke your questions into\nthe stream of thought in this blog about the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals\nComplex.\nWhat Qualifies as Answers?\nI seek answers that possess the following attributes:\nGeneral answers are not informative about ethane cracking,\nnatural gas production, or the plastics industry. Rather, the\nPennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex remains the focus of all\nanswers.\nPrimary sources are desired, not secondary reports.\nOften-cited and -repeated story lines about energy topics can originate\nin social media postings, manifestos from opposing or supporting\nadvocacy groups, releases from public relations groups representing\nclients, or public statements from energy-using or -producing firms\nthemselves. These secondary sources of fact, intention, or opinion –\nsometimes abstracted from primary sources – might be wholly or partially\ntrue. Yet, a careful examiner desires more primary direct, accountable\ninformation. For instance, citation of a press release about the amount\nof CO\\(_{2}\\) a facility will emit is\nless desirable information than an official, legal filing with\nregulatory authorities about the amount and kind of pollutants a\nfacility certifies that it expects to emit. However, secondary sources\nmight contain the only hints available about operational and\nfinancial details and intentions. Non-disclosure and translucence in\nsecondary sources about such matters as technology, intentions,\nunanticipated events, and financing, in fact, can support strategy of\nactors representing specific interests.\nOpen access and transparency about answers are necessary.\nFor example, a publicly-accessible summary of an otherwise\ninaccessible10 report is nothing more than\ninformation that remains inaccessible for critical review. Also,\ninformation that is not accessible and about which details are hidden,\nselectively screened, or incompetently reported makes kernel information\nunverifiable. The message plainly becomes no more than hearsay. As\nStevie Wonder once sang in his 1972 composition Superstition, “When you\nbelieve in things that you don’t understand, then you suffer.”\nIn sum: I wish to study accessible, documentable, and clear\nanswers to questions about the Pennsylvania Petrochemical\nComplex.\nBut, Wait, What Are My\nQuestions?\nSome answers to these questions are available to me already. Others\nare not. Some answers are buried in dry regulatory or technical reports.\nIt is even possible that no evidence is available to answer other\nquestions now or, perhaps, will be available in the future.\nI will refine or extend this list of questions as I learn more about\nthe Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex:\nInputs to the complex\n1.1 What goods and services does the plant purchase?1.1.1 from the region?\n1.1.2 from outside the region?\n1.1.3 with what costs?\n1.1.4 from what suppliers?\n\n1.2 What is the laborshed11 for the plant?\n1.3 How many workers are employed at the plant?1.3.1 in what occupations?\n1.3.2 for what pay?\n1.3.3 by place of residence?\n1.3.4 by licensed/credentialed workers?\n\nOutputs from the complex\n2.1 What are the products and co-products of the plant?\n2.1.1 to the region?\n2.1.2 outside the region\n2.1.3 at what prices?\n2.1.4 to what customers?\n\n2.2 What are the by-products of the plant?\n2.2.1 in what form produced?\n2.2.2 to whom and where delivered?\n2.2.4 at what costs?\n\nPerformance of the complex\n3.1 How is the activity, output, and performance of the plant\nclassified in national/regional income and product accounting\nsystems?\n3.2 What are the direct, indirect, and induced effects (current, not\nforecasted) of plant operation on employment, income, and taxes in\nregional, state, and national economies (an input-output framework\nimplied; see (Passmore\n2022))?\n3.3 What are the community trends in social and economic indicators\nover the period of plant operation?\n3.3.1 compared to the U.S.\n3.3.2 compared to Pennsylvania\n3.3.3 compared to similar communities operating without ethane\ncracking and plastic pellet manufacturing (implies a quasi-experimental\nresearch design; see (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell\n2001))\n\n3.4 What is the contribution of the plant to the financial returns\nto its owners (as shown in ad hoc and periodic reports to shareholders\nand other stakeholders)?\n3.5 In what regulatory/enforcement actions has the plant been\ninvolved?\nAnd, Where Are Answers\nDocumented?\nI request that you share information with me about these and other\nuseful questions or, better yet, provide answers to questions using the\nDisqus contact form at the bottom of this page.

An input-output model accounts for goods and\nservices that are required as inputs by industries to produce\noutputs of goods and services necessary to satisfy supply\nrequirements for inputs to other industries and delivery directly to\nconsumers (Miernyk\n1965).\nInput-output modeling is a way to measure the effects of a project,\nprogram, activity, or event on the structure or conditions of economic\nlife in a country, area, or period. Use of input-output modeling is\npervasive in the assessment of economic impact. However, this modeling\ntechnique often is misapplied and debauched by various rakehells of\nacademia and consulting to fulfill patently politically-motivated\nspending of public funds. For these reasons, understanding the ways and\nmeans of input-output modeling is essential for weighing critically any\nassertions about economic impact.1\nIn this paper, I outline the details of the input-output model and\nits assumptions, outline common uses (and some concerns about abuses) of\nthe model to estimate potential economic impact, and list selected\nsoftware and systems available for input-output modeling. In doing so, I\ndo not get into any depth in the vast literature on input-output\nmodeling. Nor do I establish a critical or skeptical stance about this\nmodeling or its uses. For the most part, I offer in this blog posting a\ntechnical description, unadorned by advocacy or patronage, of\ninput-output modeling. I will refer to the technical base offered in\nthis blog posting to support my reviews and commentaries about a variety\nof economic impact reports that I will make in other blog postings.\nSpecification of the\nInput-Output Model\nProduction and Consumption\nConsider an economy with \\(I\\)\nproducing industries and \\(J\\)\npurchasing industries, where \\(I = J\\).\nSome of the output of industry \\(i\\) is\nsold to industry \\(j\\) for use in its\nown production.\nLet \\(\\textbf{X}\\) stand for a\nsquare matrix of transactions among industries, with elements \\(x_{ij}\\) containing the dollar value of\ngoods and services sold by producing industry \\(i\\) to purchasing industry \\(j\\). Sales of the product of industry \\(i\\) to itself — that is, \\(x_{i=j}\\) — are possible. For instance, the\ncoal industry also might purchase coal for use in its own production\nprocesses.\nOutput of industry \\(i\\) not\npurchased by industries for their own production instead is sold\ndirectly to consumers to meet demands for personal consumption in\nhouseholds, government purchases of defense and non-defense goods and\nservices, fixed investments such as housing and other structures, and\nexports net of imports. Let \\(\\textbf{y}\\) represent an \\(I\\)–length vector whose elements display\nthe dollar value of goods and services delivered by producing industry\n\\(i\\) to fulfill final demands of the\neconomy for personal consumption, government purchases, fixed\ninvestments, and net exports. Vector \\(\\textbf{y}\\) represents the “final demand”\nfor goods and services in an economy and is known commonly in the\nparlance of national income and product accounting practice as gross\ndomestic product (“Gross Domestic Product |\nu.s. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),” n.d.).\nDirect Requirements\nQuantities in an input–output model most commonly are expressed as\nmonetary values (e.g., as dollars, rubles, yuan, or some other form of\ncurrency used as a medium of exchange) rather than as quantities of\ngoods and services, although some energy and resource input–output\nmodels are scaled in physical quantities such as megawatts of\nelectricity, kilograms of waste, hectares of land, or liters of water\n(Weisz and Duchin 2006).\nThe production sector of the economy, then is defined by \\(\\textbf{X}\\), and \\(\\textbf{y}\\) is the consumption sector. The\ntotal output of the economy by producing industry, contained in \\(I\\)–length vector \\(\\textbf{x}\\),2 is\nequal to the sum of production and consumption, or\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{1}\n\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{X}+\\textbf{y}.\n\\end {equation}\n\\]\nDefine \\(\\textbf{A}\\), a direct\nrequirements matrix with elements \\(a_{ij}=x_{ij}/x_{j}\\) showing the\nproportion of industry \\(i\\) output\nrequired for production by industry \\(j\\). Equation (1) now becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{2}\n\\textbf{x}= \\textbf{Ax} + \\textbf{y}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nSome Assumptions About\nRequirements\nAssumptions undergird all models, which are not the entity itself but\nare an abstraction of particular features of interest. Accordingly,\ninput-output models rest on important assumptions that simplify and\ncomplicate…both at the same time.\nElements in \\(\\textbf{A}\\) are\nassumed to be fixed, homogeneous, and linear within purchasing\nindustries. I dwell on these assumptions because they are at the very\ncore of the operation as well as the credibility of input-output\nmodeling.\nFixed\nInputs required by purchasing industry \\(j\\) from producing industry \\(i\\) do not change over time. More\ntechnically, zero elasticity of price or quantity substitution exists\namong inputs to purchasing industry \\(j\\). Increasing or decreasing industry\nj output requires increasing or decreasing industry i\ninputs in the same proportion. “In other words,” according to the Bureau\nof Economic Research for the U.S. Department of Commerce,(“Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS\nII) User’s Guide | u.s. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),”\nn.d.) “…businesses can use as many inputs as needed without\nfacing higher prices.” An implication is that no bottlenecks in supply\nare recognized in static input-output models, even though economic\ndifficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic show that supply constraints\nare a disruptive fact of economic life. In these ways, coefficients in\n\\(\\textbf{A}\\) are assumed to be\nfixed.\nHomogeneous\nAll firms and establishments in purchasing industry \\(j\\) use the same, fixed proportion of\nindustry \\(i\\) inputs. That is, no\nvariation exists in resource and product markets within an industry.\nSame suppliers; same customers; same technology of production. Every\nproducer in an industry does the same thing and is affected by market\nforces in the same way. In this sense, industries are rendered\nhomogeneous in input-output modeling.\nAn aside about terminology and classification applicable to the the\nassumption of homogeneity of industries in input-output modelings:3 \nA fundamental rule followed in most input-output modeling is that\nthe least common denominator of analysis occurs the level of an\nindustry, which is an aggregation of activity by highly similar\ngoods or services and business activity, and not by firm or within\nestablishments run by firms. Industry output is produced by\nfirms, which are for-profit business organizations, such as a\ncorporations, limited liability companies, or partnership. A number of\nfirms can contribute to an industry. As I shall explain in the\nnext item in this side discussion, industries are not mutually exclusive\ncollections of firms. Separate industries might include some of the same\nfirms. Also, firms might own or manage multiple establishments at which\nindustry production occurs. An establishment is a single\nlocation where business is conducted or where services/operations are\nperformed.4 In general, the production flow\nmoves from establishments within firms and, then, to\nindustries.\nTo add complexity to the input-output accounting scheme, some\nfirms produce multiple goods and services that are classifiable in\nmultiple industries. For instance, the production of food-safe,\nnon-denatured alcohol distilled from grain5 is\naccounted as output of the Denatured Alcohol Manufacturing\nIndustry (NAICS6 325193, (“NAICS Code: 325193 Ethyl Alcohol\nManufacturing,” n.d.)). Grain remaining after\ndistillation is a co-product7 product of denatured\nalcohol manufacturing and could be classified as a product of the\nOther Animal Food Manufacturing Industry (NAICS 311119, (“NAICS Code: 311119 Other Animal Food\nManufacturing,” n.d.)). One single process, two\nseparate products.\nAn economy is understood as an open system that can gain or lose\nincome or products from outside its boundaries through trade. Moreover,\nany aggregations such as firms, cities, geopolitical regions, countries,\nor the entire world could form the boundaries of an economy examined. As\ndescribed the Encyclopedia of Social Measurement (Leeuwen, Nijkamp, and\nRietveld 2005), large, diversified economies producing many\ngoods and services can demonstrate large economic impacts because (a) a\nlarge region can fulfill its demand for goods and services from within\nthe region, (b) transportation of goods and services with the region is\nsimpler than hauling in these resources, and (c) economic activity in\nlarge region tends to agglomerate sales to surrounding regions. For\nthese reasons, specification of the kind and level of aggregation of\nindustry data can have a profound effect on an assessment of economic\nimpact.\nLinear\nNeither economies nor diseconomies of scale occur as producing\nindustry \\(j\\) output increases or\ndecreases (i.e., linear). Also, this assumption implies that\nscale – and the institutional knowledge aggregated from collective work\n– has no bearing on the dollar value of resources required for\nproduction or for the functioning of the product market.\nAre These Assumptions\nRealistic?\nHow correct are these assumptions? How important even is\nverisimilitude of the assumptions with reality?\nThese three assumptions – fixed, homogeneous, linear – about the\nnature of direct input-output requirements are, of course, highly\nrestrictive and probably are unrealistic attributes to assign to most\neconomies. In spite of that, many analysts choose to believe that these\nassumptions have proved tenable within limits and useful for economic\nanalysis in static contexts, even without adding additional complexity\nto expand the simple model represented by equation (2). Rather, the use\nof the model often rests on the verisimilitude of its assumptions with\nreality. Many analysts have relied on the pragmatic view that these\nassumptions are close enough to short-term reality to allow answers to\neconomic problems that do not lend themselves to other analytic\ntechniques (Goldman\n1965).\nThe John Locke Foundation is one critic of common input-output\nmodeling applications. The Foundation asserts (“Economic Impact Studies: The Missing\nIngredient Is Economics” 2017a) that many modeling\nefforts fail to consider opportunity costs – that is, forgone\nbenefits that could accrue from an option not chosen. Most studies using\ninput-output analysis only consider benefits of a project, but fail to\nconsider or model the costs of a project.\nOf course, any new economic activity viewed without costs always will\ndemonstrate unalloyed benefits. Something is larger than nothing, right?\nThe “big-benefits-with-few-costs” approach is quite compelling to\nlegislators, policy-makers, and funding agencies seeking to convince the\npublic that projects, events, or changes are indispensable for economic\ngrowth and community revitalization (Sanders 2015). The John Locke Foundation\nasserts that input-output modeling is so often conducted “by\nprofessional consulting firms who are hired by interest groups to do the\nstudies. Furthermore, seldom do those who actually perform the studies\nhave formal training in economics. Instead their expertise is in\nusing…proprietary [input-output] models (“Economic Impact Studies: The Missing\nIngredient Is Economics” 2017b)”.\nIgnoring opportunity costs and other modes of failure to think ahead\nto consider full economic consequences prompted Frédéric Bastiat, French\neconomist best known for his journalistic writing in favor of free trade\nand the economics of Adam Smith, wrote in his last published pamphlet in\n1850 that:\n\nIn the economic sphere an act, a habit, an institution, a law\nproduces not only one effect, but a series of effects. Of these effects,\nthe first alone is immediate; it appears simultaneously with its cause;\nit is seen. The other effects emerge only subsequently; they are not\nseen; we are fortunate if we foresee them.\n\n\nThere is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one:\nthe bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good\neconomist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those\neffects that must be foreseen (Bastiat 1964).\n\nI do not mean to ignore these importance of these assumptions and\ncriticisms of them. I will take up these matters directly as I review\nreports of economic impact in other postings on this blog.\nIndirect\nand, then, Total Requirements (The Leontief Inverse)\nIntroducing for mathematical convenience an \\(I x J\\) identity matrix, \\(\\textbf{I}\\), and algebraically rearranging\nterms in equation (2), the relationships among production, consumption\nand economic output is expressed as\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{3}\n\\textbf{x}=(\\textbf{I} - \\textbf{A})^{-1}\\textbf{y},\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\((\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\) is called a total requirements matrix\nthat shows the additional dollar value of output from industry \\(i\\) needed directly or indirectly to\ndeliver a dollar’s worth of output from industry \\(j\\) to final demand in the economy. The\nmatrix inverse, \\((\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\), often is described as the Leontief\nInverse,8 in honor of Wassily Leontief (Leontief 1936, 1966), an\neconomist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1973\nfor developing economic input–output analysis theory and methods (“The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic\nSciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1973,” n.d.).\nActual economies can have large numbers of industries, so \\(\\textbf{A}\\) often is highly dimensional.\nAs a consequence, \\((\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\) usually is solved numerically by computational\ntechniques involving Laplace transforms and Lagrange multipliers.\nTaking the difference between the total requirements matrix and the\ndirect requirements matrix produces an indirect requirements\nmatrix. Indirect requirements are generated from the long string of\ntransactions among industries representing intermediate production that\nmust occur to generate a final product for consumption. The addition of\nhouseholds as both a row and column in \\(\\textbf{X}\\) allows inclusion of the\neffects of household production and purchasing into the model. This\naddition augments the total requirements matrix to include not only\ndirect and indirect requirements but also to show induced effects of\nhousehold spending on the economy as it stimulates purchases of goods\nand services. The difference between the total requirements matrices,\nnet of the indirect requirements matrix, including household spending\nproduces an induced requirements matrix.\nMultipliers\nIndirect and induced requirements matrices display how each dollar\nspent on goods and services delivered to consumers multiplies itself\nthroughout the economy. Ratios between [(direct requirements \\(+\\) indirect requirements) \\(/\\) direct requirements] as well as ratios\nbetween [(direct requirements \\(+\\)\nindirect requirements \\(+\\) induced\nrequirements) \\(/\\) direct\nrequirements] are called Type I and Type II\nmultipliers, respectively. Pre–multiplying the direct, indirect, and\ninduced requirements matrices by, say, total employment parses the\nimpact of delivery of final demand to consumers into direct, indirect,\nand induced employment components. In a similar manner, multipliers for\nother economic indicators – such as economic output, value added,\nincome, taxes – can be computed.\nPeople who commission input-output modeling of potential economic\nimpact often are most interested in multipliers to demonstrate that an\ninvestment of public funds in a project can benefit an entire community.\nFor example, an analysis of the potential economic impact of a\npetrochemical manufacturing facility in Beaver County (north of\nPittsburgh, PA) concludes\n\n…operations will involve approximately 240 to 450 new jobs for Beaver\nCounty residents at the petrochemical facility. With multipliers, total\nnew jobs held by Beaver County residents are anticipated to be between\n777 and 1,444. Annual labor income increases in Beaver County will be\nbetween approximately $73 and $120 million. Over the 40-year operational\nlife of the Project, labor income increases within Beaver County are\nestimated to total between $1.5 and $2.4 billion. Annual value added in\nBeaver County would be between $260 and $846 million. Over the assumed\n40-year operation period, this equates to a present value of $10.3 to\n$16.7 billion.(Clinton, Minutolo, and\nO’Roark 2021) \n\nThis analysis and other assertions about economic impact of operation\nof the petrochemical facility supported state and local tax breaks for\nthe developer:\n\nPennsylvania’s fiscal incentive package — which includes a large tax\ncredit along with job-training incentives — was also crucial to the\ncompany’s decision to both proceed with the project and locate it in\nPennsylvania, Visser said.\nIn 2012, state lawmakers authorized a tax credit for companies that\nuse ethane that invest more than $1 billion and employ more than 2,500\nworkers during construction. Shell was given a 25-year tax break worth\nabout $66 million a year starting in 2017, or about $1.65 billion in\ntotal. The state also extended a tax-free Keystone Opportunity Zone in\nBeaver County and provided other grants.\n“I can tell you with the hand on my heart that without these fiscal\nincentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” Visser\n[Royal Dutch Shell representative] said. (“Location and Tax Breaks Key to\nShell’s Pennsylvania Cracker Plant Approval | Reuters\nEvents | Downstream,” n.d.)\n\nUse of\nCounterfactuals to Identify Potential Economic Impact\nWhat is a Counterfactual?\nInput-output modeling is useful for describing of the anatomy and\nphysiology of an economy. However, these models also offer a basis for\nsimulating economic scenarios that are “counter to the facts” to inform\nrisk assessment.\nA counterfactual is a hypothetical scenario that runs\n“counter to the facts” of an existing reality. A counterfactual\ncondition entails “What if…?” questions that represent thought\nexperiments about propositions that run counter to the facts. For\ninstance, how would an economy have grown and changed if an activity or\nevent did not occur? How do supply chain constraints or disruptions\naffect an innovation? The potential impact of an activity, event, or\nconstraint is the difference between what would have happened with and,\nthen, without the activity, event, or constraint.\nResearchers long have used the counterfactual approach to consider\nstrategic decisions, decisive acts, and paths of activity that would\nhave altered the course of history. For instance, in Ab Urbe Condita\nLibri (Ab urbe condita libri,\niterum recognovit 1873),9\nTitus Livius Patavinus, a Roman historian, contemplated an alternative\nin 4th century BC by questioning, “What would have been the results for\nRome if she had been engaged in war with Alexander?” Lewis (Lewis 1974) indicated that the modern\ncounterfactual approach goes back at least to the 18th century Scottish\nEnlightenment philosopher David Hume.\nHistorians, essayists, and novelists have applied counterfactual\nthinking productively in a variety of situations. For instance, in 1931\nWinston Churchill wrote an essay, “If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of\nGettysburg,” (Churchill\n2014) that examined the counterfactual viewpoint about what\nwould have happened if the Confederacy had won the American Civil War10 (see counterfactual examples\nregarding the American Civil War (Lewis 1931)). In 1962, Philip K. Dick, a\nnovelist in the science fiction genre, published The Man in the High\nCastle (Dick 1962), a\nnarrative of a thought experiment that considered the consequences if\nNazi Germany and Imperial Japan had won the Second World War.\nConstructing\nCounterfactuals Within Input-Output Modeling\nInput–output modeling can help examine counterfactuals. The typical\nway to conduct such a counterfactual approach is to construct and\ncompare two economic scenarios. The first scenario contains a possible\nalteration in the economy – the counterfactual – that would be\nidentified in input-output terms an economic changes resulting from,\nsay, an innovation (e.g., a new production process), event (e.g., a\ndisaster), policy (e.g. immigration regulation), or financial rule\n(e.g., taxing authority). A second scenario merely maintains the “status\nquo” of the economy under the assumption that the economy simply grows\nand changes consistently according to historical trends. The difference\nbetween the first and the second scenarios is the potential economic\nimpact of the economic alteration specified in the first scenario.\nThe results of such counterfactual economic analyses are not economic\nforecasts. Rather, such analyses isolate the importance only of one\nnarrow group of changes in an economy by showing the gross effect of\nthese changes rather that the effect of changes net of all other\npotential changes taken together that could affect an economy. A\ncounterfactual used with input–output methods typically is specified\nunder the assumption of ceteris paribus – that is, with the\nassumption of “all other things remaining the same” or, as is much more\nrestrictively used in physics and other sciences (Cartwright 1980), “if, and only if, all\nother things are the same and correct” More restrictively,\nceteris absentibus, a term meaning literally “others absent,”\nprobably best describes the approach for economic counterfactuals (Joseph 1980).\nAn Example of a\nCounterfactual Specification\nA potential impact of a counterfactual is computed by calculating the\ndifference between (a) an economic scenario created by a counterfactual\ncondition exemplifying a production or consumption shock and (b) a\nstatus quo scenario representing an economy anticipated under historical\ntrends in growth and change. Shown in Table 1 are three classes of\ncounterfactuals that are possible in a hypothetical case for the\nproduction and consumption of transparent aluminum, a material\nI introduce only to offer an example of the structure of potential\ncounterfactuals in input-output analysis.\nTable 1. Three hypothetical macroeconomic counterfactuals\nspecified to assess risk to production and consumption of transparent\naluminum\nCounterfactual description\nChange specified in macroeconomic model\nChange in consumption of transparent aluminum\n\\(\\Delta y_{i'}\\), where\nelement \\(y_{i'}\\), is total final\ndemand for industry \\(i'\\), the\ntransparent aluminum industry (where \\(i'\\subseteq I\\)).\nChange in production function for the transparent aluminum\nindustry\n\\(\\Delta a_{j'}\\), where vector\n\\(a_{j'}\\) is a column vector\nrepresenting the proportion of inputs from \\(I\\) industries purchased as inputs to the\ntransparent aluminum industry (where \\(j'\\subseteq J\\)).\nChange in production function of a purchaser of transparent\naluminum\n\\(\\Delta a_{j}\\), where vector\n\\(a_{j}\\) is a column vector\nrepresenting the proportion of inputs from \\(I\\) industries purchased as inputs to any\nindustry other than the transparent aluminum industry (where\n\\(j' ≠ j\\)).\nTransparent aluminum, a ceramic composite technically known as\naluminum magnesium oxynitride, is an extremely durable,\nsintered crystalline material composed of magnesium, aluminum, oxygen,\nand nitrogen (AlN-MgO-MgAl2O4) that is optically transparent\n(≥80%) in the near-ultraviolet, visible, and midwave-infrared regions of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. The name of this material comes from its\nsimilarity to a material referenced in the science fiction movie,\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home.11\nTransparent aluminum is a promising material that is four times\nharder than fused silica glass, 85% as hard as sapphire, and resists\ncorrosion, radiation, and oxidation (Nishiyama et al. 2017). Products\nrequiring both durability and transparency – such as armored glass,\nwindshields on airplanes and sea vessels, windows for laser and infrared\ncommunications, personal protective gear, smartphone and watch screens,\nand sensor components – are among the potential uses for transparent\naluminum.\nChange in\nconsumption of transparent aluminum\nUsing equation (3), implementing this counterfactual involves\nsubstitution of \\(y_{i'}\\) for\n\\(y_{i}\\) and solving for \\((\\textbf{x}=(\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\textbf{y'}\\), where \\(y'\\) is a new column vector of total\nfinal demand for industry \\(i'\\),\nthe transparent aluminum industry (\\(i'\\subseteq I\\)). The result is a\ndirect change in transparent aluminum output, along with indirect and\ninduced changes of the total output of all industries to the extent that\nthey have direct or indirect interindustry linkages to the transparent\naluminum industry.\nChange\nin production function for the transparent aluminum industry\nChanging a production function involves altering the proportion of\ntotal products from other industries purchased by the transparent\naluminium industry. This change could result from efficiencies affected\nin the production of transparent aluminium. Or, supply chain constraints\nor shortages might have required changes in the manner that transparent\naluminium is produced. Such a change is manifest in alterations in \\(\\textbf{A}\\). As a result, \\((\\textbf{x}=(\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\) also is altered, reestablishing the\ninput-output identity to \\((\\textbf{x}=(\\textbf{I} -\n\\textbf{A'})^{-1}\\textbf{y}\\) where \\(\\textbf{A'}\\) is \\(\\textbf{A}\\) altered by \\(a_{j'}\\), a column vector representing\nthe proportion of inputs from \\(I\\)\nindustries purchased as inputs to the transparent aluminum industry\n(\\(j'\\subseteq J\\)). The result\nobserved, holding transparent aluminum output constant, is indirect and\ninduced changes of the total output of all industries to the extent that\nthey have direct or indirect interindustry linkages to the transparent\naluminum industry.\nChange\nin production function of a purchaser of transparent aluminium\nThe consequence of this scenario is a similar change similar to\nchanges in the production function for the transparent aluminum\nindustry. However, the result observed, holding output constant in the\nindustry making the production function change, is indirect and induced\nchanges of the total output of all industries, including the transparent\naluminum industry, to the extent that they have direct or indirect\ninterindustry linkages to the industry making the production function\nchange.\nSelected\nSoftware and Systems for Input-Output Modeling\nMany software and systems are available to analyze input-output data\nfrom the national income and product accounts of the United States (viz\ndescription of accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce (“An Introduction to the National Income and\nProduct Accounts” 2007). Three prominent sets of\nsoftware and systems are IMPLAN, RIMS II, and\nIO-Snap.\nIMPLAN\nIMPLAN (IMpact for\nPLanning and ANalysis) is a prominent example of\nsoftware used estimate the direct, indirect, and induced impacts in\nregional economies. The IMPLAN economic impact modeling system consists\nof software tools and region–specific data to enable in–depth\nexaminations of state, multi–county, county, sub–county, and\nmetropolitan regional economies. IMPLAN seems to have a large share of\nthe market for input-output modeling. Some writers (e.g., (Vowels 2012) ) describe IMPLAN as the\n“gold standard” for input-output analysis.\nRIMS II\nRIMS\nII is a product of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce that is based on a set of national input-output\naccounts showing the goods and services produced by each industry and\nthe use of these goods and services by industries and final users.\nIO-Snap\nIO-Snap is a software\napplication that includes all aspects of fundamental input-output\nanalyses. Data can be edited and displayed in a variety of formats and\ncompared and contrasted across geographical definitions at different\ntimes.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 07:43:38 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\n\nThis essay, written with Rose M. Baker, originally was published in\nMarcellus Business Central on October 7, 2011 (Volume\n1, Issue 5, pages 9 and 15) when natural gas development in Pennsylvania\nstarted in earnest and when a natural gas severance tax was opposed\nstrongly by gas industry representatives. “Taxing us will kill jobs. You\nwant that?”\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hydraulic Fracturing\n\n\n\nMany Pennsylvanians are confused about clashes of findings between\ntwo prominent studies of the economic impacts of Marcellus Shale\ndevelopment in Pennsylvania.\nOne report was published during August by the Marcellus Shale\nEducation and Training Center (MSETC), a collaboration between\nPennsylvania College of Technology and Penn State Extension (Kelsey et al. 2009). MSETC estimated\nthat Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania generated between\n23,385 and 23,884 jobs and almost $1.9 billion in regional gross\ndomestic product in 2009.\nAnother report, published during late July, is the third in a series\nof reports authored by researchers, working through Penn State’s John\nand Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering,\nabout the status, impact, and potential of Pennsylvania’s Marcellus\nnatural gas industry (Considine, Watson, and Blumsack 2010).\nBy way of contrast with the report by MSETC, this study estimated that\nPennsylvania Marcellus natural gas development generated $11.2 billion\nin regional gross domestic product and supported nearly 140,000 jobs\nduring 2010.\nThe magnitude of the differences between the outcomes of the MSETC\nand Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering studies is too large to\nbe attributed to the differences between 2009 and 2010 in the\nPennsylvania economy and in the level of the natural gas industry’s\nactivity. Much of the comparison in the popular press between the two\nstudies has surrounded who funded and conducted the studies.\nThe MSETC study was funded by the Pennsylvania Economic Development\nFinancing Authority. Three of its authors work for Penn State, with help\nfrom a former Penn State faculty member now working in Colorado.\nThe Marcellus Shale Coalition funded the research leading to the\nstudy reported from the Penn State Department of Energy and Mineral\nEngineering. The Coalition is registered in Pennsylvania as a 501(c)(6)\ntax exempt organization that represents the natural gas industry to the\ngovernment, regulators, and the public. Most of the authors of this\nstudy are not affiliated with Penn State. One author is a former Penn\nState professor and another is a retired Penn State professor, while a\nthird is current Penn State professor.\nMany people refer to both studies as “Penn State” studies, although\nyou can be certain that there is no such thing as a common, sanctioned\nPenn State position on Marcellus Shale development around which all\nfaculty researchers rally. As one of our colleagues observed, over 3,500\nfull–time professors are employed by Penn State, guaranteeing also that\nthere could be over 3,500 independent postures and attitudes about\nMarcellus Shale at Penn State, some of which change daily.\nThink the University has one voice on Marcellus Shale? Think\nagain.\nMany commentators dismiss the Coalition–funded study as the product\nof biased analysis conducted by hacks hired for industry lobbyists and,\nthen, laundered with a Penn State logo to simulate the patina of\nscholarly gravitas. The MSETC report has received little criticism yet,\neven though it, too, was funded by a government agency with skin in the\ngame.\nReceiving research funds from sources external to the University is\nquite common. Research is an added expense that has social benefits\nbeyond the University and, for the most part, is unfunded in the\nUniversity’s core budget. Also, modern science is conducted worldwide\namong collaborators, with little attention to institutional boundaries.\nNo one should be surprised that research at universities primarily is\nfunded externally and is conducted collaboratively.\nSo, we believe that criticizing these studies based on who funded and\nconducted them is the wrong approach to assessing their quality. Rather,\nthe studies must be judged on their scientific merits.\nFirst, let’s examine the analytical foundation that runs through both\nstudies.\nThe MSETC study and the Coalition–funded study investigated economic\nimpacts using IMPLAN (most recent citation: “Economic Impact\nAnalysis for Planning | IMPLAN” 2019), a highly\nquantitative, computationally-intensive macroeconomic model that is\nconsidered by many to be the gold standard1 for\nassessing the economy–wide outcomes of regional economic activities,\ndevelopments, and events. We use IMPLAN in our own research.\nAs many commentators have noted, IMPLAN has a variety of assumptions\nand limitations, requires mathematical skill to use correctly, is\ncomplex, and often is misapplied.2 However, the authors of\nboth the MSETC study and the Coalition–funded study demonstrate the\nexperience and accomplishment of grizzled IMPLAN users who are quite\ncompetent in specifying, conducting, and reporting IMPLAN analyses.\nNow, down to the actual analytical differences between the MSETC\nstudy and the Coalition–funded study.\nFrom our view, the differences in study outcomes are driven by some\nkey differences in the numbers entered into IMPLAN for each study. As\nthe authors of the MSETC study asserted, these differences in outcomes\nare due to differences in “detailed information on where leasing,\nroyalty, and payroll were going.”\nThe Coalition–funded study assumed that all lease and royalty income\nearned through natural gas development and production remains within\nPennsylvania and, furthermore, is spent during the year in which it is\nreceived. However, these assumptions do not seem reasonable.\nSome of this lease and royalty income “leaks” outside the\nCommonwealth and much is saved rather than spent. Based on data\ncollected from Pennsylvania households and businesses, MSETC assumed\nconservatively that between 7.7 and 15.4% of lease and royalty dollars\nare earned out–of–state. MSETC’s data also led to the assumption that\nlandowners save, rather than spend, 55% of lease payments and 66% of\nroyalty payments.\nThe evidence-fueled assumptions by MSETC of lower lease and royalty\nincome spent in the state and more lease and royalty income saved for\nthe future produce lower economic impacts than those estimated in the\nCoalition–funded study.\nThe Coalition–funded study assumed that the payroll of Marcellus\nShale workers was earned and spent by Pennsylvanians alone. The MSETC\nstudy applied data from surveys and other studies to make the\nassumptions that 37% of Marcellus Shale workers are not Pennsylvania\nresidents and that these non–residents spent between 50 to 75% of their\nearnings in Pennsylvania on a more restricted set of purchases (e.g.,\nfocusing on food and lodging) than Pennsylvanians do.\nMSETC’s assumptions of fewer Marcellus Shale earnings spent in\nPennsylvania on a limited set of purchases equal lower economic impact\nestimates than produced through the Coalition–funded study.\nThe full story of the net economic impact of Marcellus Shale activity\nremains to be told.^[Not much action to research these impacts since the\nthese early squabbles about potential economic outcomes from developing\nand producing gas from Marcellus Shale formations. I believe that this\nis because the representatives no longer seem threatened by the\npossibility of a severance tax, which Pennsylvania never has had the\npolitical will to enact. ] However, at this point, the MSETC study\nappears to us to be more credible scientifically and practically than\nthe Coalition–funded study.\n\n[1] \"2022-06-23 16:39:23 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.
