    "contents": "\nI drove to Monaca, Pennsylvania, yesterday to view Shell’s ethane\ncracker. The trip reminded me about a report I wrote in 2012 for a\nWorkforce Investment Board, “Cracking the Ethane Cracker”.\n\nI calculated in 2012 a much lower potential impact of the working\ncracker in Monaca on employment, income, and jobs than did the American\nChemical Society, whose evidence was used to gather support and tax\nrelief for the cracker project. Exaggeration of the economic impact of\noil/gas/gas liquids activities is evident in many projects (see, e.g.,\n“Penn State studies” of Marcellus Shale development impacts; see my mild\ngriping in the essay, Different Numbers in, Different\nNumbers Out.\nWhy the exaggeration? I would think that many of these projects have\npositive impacts that stand on their own. Perhaps these exaggerations of\necon impact are meant to divert attention from environmental impacts?\nThe message is “Sure, there are environmental impacts, but look at the\njobs, income, and taxes we create.”\nAny continuing projects to track the various impacts of the cracker?\nA few are evident:\nHealth\nImpact Assessment of the Shell Chemical Appalachia Petrochemical\nComplex \nSupport\nFor Shell Tax Break In Monaca, But Skepticism Over Job\nClaims\n\n\n\n",
