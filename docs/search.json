I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher\neducation for 51 years. My background, experiences, and accomplishments\nare detailed elsewhere.\nhow these NOTES are\nrendered\nI live as a geeky nerd.\nI write and code these NOTES in\nRMarkdown\nsyntax in\nRStudio\nusing blogging tools provided in the\nR\nprogramming package titled\ndistill.\nI render the blog through\nPandoc\ninto\n\nhtml from the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to\nmy\nGitHub account, from which it is served publicly through the\ndomain\nname, davidpassmore.github.io/blog/.\nI do not implement cookies and other tracking tools with this blog\nsite, except to count user visits through Google Analytics. So, if you\nshow up here, I will not sneak behind you to follow you home.\nwhat’s here?\nI live a lot of my life doing reading, writing, and arithmetic.\nThese NOTES span topics that reflect the range of ideas, learnings,\nand challenges that I encounter daily as I sit at a table with my\ncomputers in front of large windows that look over trees, birds, and\ndaily neighborhood activities from our 4th-floor condo in the Shadyside\nneighborhood of Pittsburgh.\nMotivating these NOTES is a hope to engage with others. Perhaps more\nprimary is the need to clarify meanings I attach to my perceptions of\nevents, activities, and experiences.\nI integrate my perceptions into essays using, where possible, the\ntools of data science to undergird my arguments. It’s not all a pile of\ngrim, grinding screeds, though. I drop in a few idiographic memories of\nmy experiences and my slanted opinions about emprises offered by\nlife.\nI don’t know whether I am a boho or just a lazy cad, but I rarely\ndecide completely what I will write until I struggle to write it. As E.\nM. Forster, English fiction writer, essayist and librettist, reputedly\nonce wrote, “How do I know what I think until I see what I say?”\nI ran a blog at the now out-of-service domain, motime.com,\nduring the early 2000s. I retrieved some of my longer postings to this\nformer blog from The Wayback\nMachine. I re-posted a few of these dormant postings here as\nnew NOTES’ essays.\nhow I engage\nI live my life as a retired person.\nI rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt to follow\nsome monastic way. No, I see it as a quiet time, an opportunity to\norganize and prepare, and a chance to have a few accomplishments before\nthe rest of the world starts moving.\nI meet over my cup of morning coffee with long-time friends on Zoom\nmeetings from 6:30 to 7:30 am on Mondays through Saturdays. I spend the\nremainder of my time on most days on projects selected from too many to\ndo. Sometimes I hold video conferences with friends and collaborators\nworldwide to gain insights into issues and solutions to problems.\ncontacts with me\nFriends, I live in gated community of my own construction.\nSend an email to me using the email address:\ndlp AT davidpassmore dot net. I take iMsgs and\nSMS messages at dlp@psu.edu. My Twitter\nhandle is @DLPPassmore, where I am available publicly. I\nalso run Slack teams for my former students and family. In\nthese student and family teams, I typically am available instantly.\nI read Reddit (mostly r/pittsburgh), but I post\nthere infrequently because I try to stay out of hand-to-hand combat at\nmy age. Although I have placeholder accounts on many social media apps,\nI do not do in any depth the FaceBooks or the\nLinkedIns like the kids like to do. Those crazy kids, eh? How\ncan you keep up? So, not much of me is available on most social media\napps.\nThe telephone? Nah. I seldom pick up, except for family or for calls\nfrom close associates. Calling me without leaving a message results in\nnumber blocking.1 I do use Instagram, but I\nam only deeply hidden and accessible by family.\nI live in a secure building. So, instead of confronting me\nface-to-face like you are a member of the press heckling a public\nofficial being frog marched to a hearing on criminal charges, post any\nexpressions of unhappiness and ill-will to me via email or Twitter,\nwhere I will incorporate good ideas2 into my life flow. Or,\ninstead, as if kept awake the night before by a bit of indigestible\npotato, I will press flush to exhaust you into the cold plasma and,\nthen, on quickly through the pipes to the vast, dark cesspool I keep in\nthe corner of my private universe. You have been warned!\nvr, David\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-08-17 09:05:09 EDT\"\n\n\nPlease note: my car warranty is as I\nlike it; my grandchildren do not require me to bail them out of jail;\nthe Internal Revenue Service is not trying to reach me urgently. I will\nnever own a timeshare, nor, I guarantee, would you want me to.↩︎\n…even those ideas I never considered\nor initially might seem out-of-sync with my settled patterns↩︎\n",
