My mother called me\n            David, which works for you, too.\n            \n            how these NOTES are rendered\n            These NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where\n            I have lived since 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for\n            41 years and in higher education for 51 years. Additional\n            details about my background, experiences, and\n            accomplishments\n            are\n            available elsewhere.\n            I write these NOTES in\n            RMarkdown\n            code in\n            RStudio\n            using blogging tools provided in the\n            R\n            programming package titled\n            distill.\n            I render the blog in\n            html\n            from the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to\n            my\n            GitHub account, from which it is served publicly through\n            the\n            domain\n            name, davidpassmore.github.io/blog/.\n            Cookies and other tracking tools are not implemented on this\n            blog site.\n            \n            \n            what’s here?\n            These NOTES cover a wide variety of topics that reflect\n            the range of ideas, learnings, and challenges that I\n            encounter daily as I sit with my computers at a table in\n            front of the large windows that look over trees, birds, and\n            daily neighborhood activities from our 4th floor condo in\n            the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.\n            I ran a blog at a now out-of-service, motime.com\n            dring the early 2000s. I retrieved some of my longer\n            postings to this former blog from The Wayback\n            Machine at https://archive.org. I re-posted a few of\n            these essays here.\n            \n            \n            how I engage\n            I live my days as a retired person.\n            I rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt\n            to follow some monastic way. No, see it as a quiet time, an\n            opportunity to organize and prepare, and a chance to have a\n            few accomplishments before the rest of the world starts\n            moving. I meet over my cup of morning coffee with long-time\n            friends on a Zoom meeting from 6:30 to 7:30 am on Mondays\n            through Saturdays.\n            The remainder of my time on most days is spent on\n            projects selected from too many to do. Sometimes I video\n            conference with friends and collaborators across the world\n            to gain insights into issues and solutions to problems. I\n            swim almost daily at the wonderful\n            pool at the Squirrel Hill Jewish Community Center in\n            Pittsburgh that is so close to Mr. Fred Rogers’ former\n            residence. It is good to be in the neighborhood.\n            I am in a sleep research study that requires that I get\n            five hours of sleep per night, so I am asleep by 11:00 pm.\n            Between rising and finally going to sleep, I do the\n            purchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking, laundering,\n            medicating, cleaning, banking, and so forth to help my wife,\n            Alice.\n            Who doth ambition shun and loves to live in the\n            sun….\n            \n            \n            contacts with me\n            Friends, I am a gated community.\n            Send email to me using the email address:\n            dlp AT davidpassmore dot net.

I\n            also run Slack teams for my former students and my\n            family.

So, not much of\n            me is available on those apps.\n            The telephone? Nah. I almost never pick up, expect for\n            family or for calls from close associates. Calling me\n            without leaving a message results in number blocking.1 I do use Instagram,\n            but I am deeply hidden and accessible by family only.\n            I live in a secure building, so, instead of making direct\n            threats to me face-to-face, post any expressions of\n            unhappiness and ill-will to me via email or Twitter, where I\n            will work good ideas2 into my life flow.
