      "contents": "\nThese NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived\nsince 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher\neducation for 51 years. Additional details about my background,\nexperiences, and accomplishments\nare\navailable elsewhere.\nI write these NOTES in\nRMarkdown\ncode in\nRStudio\nusing blogging tools provided in the\nR\nprogramming package titled\ndistill.\nI render the blog in\nhtml\nfrom the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to\nmy\nGitHub account, from which it is served publicly through the\ndomain\nname, davidpassmore.github.io/blog/.\nThese NOTES cover a wide variety of topics that reflect the range of\nideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit with my\ncomputers at a table in front of the large windows that look over trees,\nbirds, and daily neighborhood activities from our 4th floor condo.\nI live my days as a retired person. I rise at 4:00 am daily. Early\nrising is not my attempt to follow some monastic way. No, see it as a\nquiet time, an opportunity to organize and prepare, and a chance to have\na few accomplishments before the rest of the world starts moving. I meet\nover my cup of morning coffee with long-time friends on Zoom from 6:30\nto 7:30 am on Mondays through Saturdays.\nThe remainder of my time on most days is spent on projects selected\nfrom too many to do. Sometimes I video conference with friends and\ncollaborators across the world. I am in a sleep research study that\nrequires that I get five hours of sleep per night, so I am asleep by\n11:00 pm. Between rising and finally going to sleep, I do the\npurchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking, laundering, medicating,\ncleaning, banking, and so forth.\nContact me using the email address:\ndlp AT davidpassmore.net.\nVr,\n\n\n\n",
