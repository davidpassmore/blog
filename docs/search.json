I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher\neducation for 51 years. Additional details about my background,\nexperiences, and accomplishments are available\nelsewhere.\nhow these NOTES are\nrendered\nI write and code these NOTES in\nRMarkdown\nsyntax in\nRStudio\nusing blogging tools provided in the\nR\nprogramming package titled\ndistill.\nI render the blog in\nhtml\nfrom the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to\nmy\nGitHub account, from which it is served publicly through the\ndomain\nname, davidpassmore.github.io/blog/. I do not implement\ncookies and other tracking tools with this blog site, except to count\nuser visits through Google Analytics.\nwhat’s here?\nThese NOTES span topics that reflect the range of ideas, learnings,\nand challenges that I encounter daily as I sit at a table with my\ncomputers in front of large windows that look over trees, birds, and\ndaily neighborhood activities from our 4th-floor condo in the Shadyside\nneighborhood of Pittsburgh.\nMotivating these NOTES is, of course, a hope to engage with others.\nBut, perhaps more primary is the need for clarify meanings I attach to\nmy perceptions of events, activities, and experiences. After all, as E.\nM. Forster, English fiction writer, essayist and librettist, reputedly\nonce wrote, “How do I know what I think until I see what I say?”\nI ran a blog at the now out-of-service domain, motime.com,\nduring the early 2000s. I retrieved some of my longer postings to this\nformer blog from The Wayback Machine at https://archive.org. I\nre-posted a few of these essays here as NOTES’ postings.\nhow I engage\nI live my life as a retired person.\nI rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt to follow\nsome monastic way. No, see it as a quiet time, an opportunity to\norganize and prepare, and a chance to have a few accomplishments before\nthe rest of the world starts moving. I meet over my cup of morning\ncoffee with long-time friends on a Zoom meeting from 6:30 to 7:30 am on\nMondays through Saturdays.\nI spend the remainder of my time on most days on projects selected\nfrom too many to do. Sometimes I hold video conferences with friends and\ncollaborators worldwide to gain insights into issues and solutions to\nproblems. I swim almost daily at the wonderful pool\nat the Squirrel Hill Jewish Community Center in Pittsburgh, that is\nso close to Mr. Fred Rogers’ former residence. It is good to be in the\nneighborhood.\nI am in a sleep research study requiring slightly five hours of sleep\nper night, so I am asleep by 10:40 pm. Between rising and finally going\nto sleep, I do the purchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking,\nlaundering, medicating, cleaning, banking, and so forth to help my wife,\nAlice.\nWho doth ambition shun and loves to live in the sun….\ncontacts with me\nFriends, I am similar to a gated community.\nSend an email to me using the email address:\ndlp AT davidpassmore dot net. I take iMsgs and\nSMS messages at dlp@psu.edu. My Twitter\nhandle is @DLPPassmore, where I am available publicly. I\nalso run Slack teams for my former students and family. In\nthese student and family teams, I typically am available instantly.\nAlthough I have placeholder accounts on many social media apps, I do\nnot do in any depth the FaceBooks or the LinkedIns\nlike the kids do. So, not much of me is available on those apps.\nThe telephone? Nah. I seldom pick up, except for family or for calls\nfrom close associates. Calling me without leaving a message results in\nnumber blocking.1 I do use Instagram, but I\nam only deeply hidden and accessible by family.\nI live in a secure building. So, instead of making direct threats to\nme face-to-face, post any expressions of unhappiness and ill-will to me\nvia email or Twitter, where I will incorporate good ideas2\ninto my life flow. Or, instead, I will press flush and exhaust you to\nfloat into the vast plasma and on to the cold, dark corners of my\nuniverse.\nvr, David\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-21 18:42:19 EDT\"\n\n\nPlease note: my car warranty is as I\nlike it; my grandchildren do not require me to bail them out of jail;\nthe Internal Revenue Service is not trying to reach me urgently; I will\nnever own a timeshare, nor, I guarantee, would you want me to.↩︎\neven those ideas I never considered\nor initially might seem out-of-sync with my settled patterns↩︎\n",
