      "contents": "\nI am David Passmore.\nhow these NOTES are rendered\nThese NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived\nsince 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher\neducation for 51 years. Additional details about my background,\nexperiences, and accomplishments\nare\navailable elsewhere.\nI write these NOTES in\nRMarkdown\ncode in\nRStudio\nusing blogging tools provided in the\nR\nprogramming package titled\ndistill.\nI render the blog in\nhtml\nfrom the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to\nmy\nGitHub account, from which it is served publicly through the\ndomain\nname, davidpassmore.github.io/blog/. Cookies and other\ntracking tools are not implemented on this blog site.\nwhat’s here?\nThese NOTES cover a wide variety of topics that reflect the range of\nideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit with my\ncomputers at a table in front of the large windows that look over trees,\nbirds, and daily neighborhood activities from our 4th floor condo in the\nShadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.\nhow I engage\nI live my days as a retired person.\nI rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt to follow\nsome monastic way. No, see it as a quiet time, an opportunity to\norganize and prepare, and a chance to have a few accomplishments before\nthe rest of the world starts moving. I meet over my cup of morning\ncoffee with long-time friends on a Zoom meeting from 6:30 to 7:30 am on\nMondays through Saturdays.\nThe remainder of my time on most days is spent on projects selected\nfrom too many to do. Sometimes I video conference with friends and\ncollaborators across the world to gain insights into issues and\nsolutions to problems. I swim almost daily at the wonderful pool\nat the Squirrel Hill Jewish Community Center in Pittsburgh that is\nso close to Mr. Fred Rogers’ former residence. It is good to be in the\nneighborhood.\nI am in a sleep research study that requires that I get five hours of\nsleep per night, so I am asleep by 11:00 pm. Between rising and finally\ngoing to sleep, I do the purchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking,\nlaundering, medicating, cleaning, banking, and so forth to help my wife,\nAlice.\nWho doth ambition shun and loves to live in the sun….\ncontacts with me\nFriends, I am a gated community.\nSend email to me using the email address:\ndlp AT davidpassmore.net. I take iMsgs and SMS\nmessages at dlp@psu.edu. My Twitter handle is\n@DLPPassmore, where I am available publicly. I also run\nSlack teams for my former students and my family. In these\nstudent and family teams, I typically am available instantly.\nAlthough I have placeholder accounts in many social media apps, I do\nnot do the FaceBooks or the LinkedIns for anything\nmeaningful. So, not much of me is available on those apps.\nThe telephone? Nah. I almost never pick up, expect for family or for\ncalls from close associates. Calling me without leaving a message\nresults in number blocking.1 I do use\nInstagram, but I am deeply hidden and accessible by family only.\nI live in a secure building, so, instead of making direct threats to\nme face-to-face, post any expressions of unhappiness and ill-will to me\nvia email or Twitter, where I will work good ideas (eve those I never\nconsidered) into my life flow. Or, instead, I will just press flush and\nexhaust you, floating, in the vast plasma of the universe.\nVr,\nDavid\n\n\nPlease note: my car warranty is as I\nlike it; my grandchildren do not require me to bail them out of jail;\nthe Internal Revenue Service is not trying to reach me urgently; I will\nnever own a timeshare, nor, I guarantee, would you want me to.↩︎\n",
