    "contents": "\nCharles Sanders Peirce, “The Fixation of Belief,” Popular Science\nMonthly (12, 1877: 1– 15), characterized “ostrich” beliefs. From\nthe Pierce article:\n\nI remember once being entreated not to read a certain newspaper lest\nit might change my opinion upon freetrade. ‘Lest I might be entrapped by\nits fallacies and misstatements,’ was the form of expression. ‘You are\nnot,’ my friend said, ’a special student of political economy. You\nmight, therefore, easily be deceived by fallacious arguments upon the\nsubject. You might, then, if you read this paper, be led to believe in\nprotection. But you admit that freetrade is the true doctrine; and you\ndo not wish to believe what is not true.’\n\n\nPierce’s statement embeds examples of two types of “epistemic\npaternalism,” that is, the restriction of how we come to know things\n(our epistemology). “First-person paternalism” involves censoring your\nown experience and thinking to avoid changing your deeply held\nbeliefs.\n“Third-person paternalism” involves having a third party tell you\nwhat to read/do for your own good. This practice of interfering with\npeople’s efforts at inquiry without their consent is based because\npeople will be better off without testing, probing, or thinking.\nConfronting and engaging arguments with an open mind about what\nappear, at first glance, to be stupid conclusions is not as risky as the\nostrich might think. On the contrary, a person can improve by being\nopen-minded.\nYou treat an argument openmindedly only if you are willing\nto change your mind in response to that argument based on evidence.\nThomas Kelly, in “Following the Argument Where It Leads,”\nPhilosophical Studies (154, 2011: 105–24), suggests following a\n“modalized reasonableness,” a disposition to believe, disbelieve, or\nsuspend judgment on any proposition whenever becomes reasonable to do\nso.\nIn Chapter 2 of On Liberty – the locus classicus for a\nphilosophical attack on censorship – John Stuart Mill considers a\ndilemma. On the one hand, perhaps the status quo opinion is false, and\nthe dissenting opinion is true. In that case, suppressing and refusing\nto engage with the dissenting opinion means foregoing an opportunity to\ncorrect ourselves. On the other hand, even if the dissenting opinion is\nfalse and is known to be so, suppressing it robs us of the opportunity\nto gain, in Mill’s words, “the clearer perception and livelier\nimpression of truth produced by its collision with error.”\nIt’s called learning; it involves thinking; its\nwhetstone is reasoning; it requires intellectual\nhumility, not arrogance. Learning, thinking, reasoning, and\nhumility currently are in short supply, I assert.\nEpistemic paternalism is the subject of many academic discussions,\nmuch of it wooly. One article that seems, as its author writes,\n“clarifactory” is available at http://bit.ly/EpistPater.

    "contents": "\nSeveral friends spoke recently about how to honor those who died in\nthe service of their country. In the United States we celebrate\nMemorial Day, a custom observed on the last Monday of May that\nis meant to honor the men and women who died while serving in the U.S.\nmilitary.\n\nThe word, “memorial,” derives from a Latin word, “memorialis,”\nmeaning “belonging to memory.” The Latin root also connotes a\nmanifestation of that memory through commemorative gesture, the\nestablishment of a monument, or the enactment of a rite.\nAnd, so, we have our Memorial Day, a day with an abundance of\nmemories and memorials for many Americans. Profound reflection. Prayer.\nPerhaps a parade and assembly at a local shrine to remember the war\ndead. Memories often spread to now-absent friends and family and to\nthoughts of the lives of those we never met, but carry in our DNA and\nlocal histories.\nFor some, though, the day concludes a long restful weekend spanning\nspring and summer, a chance to start landscaping, or a gathering of\nfamily, friends, and neighbors for a cookout and a beer. Not everyone\nhas palpable memories to ponder or even wants to consider any dark\nimages they might summon. In these ways, our Memorial Day conjures a\nfeuding horde of meanings for many Americans, much like the current\nstate of our moral and ethical life in the United States.\nBy contrast, the Greeks assigned a more singular, principled meaning\nfor a “good” death, the kind that should provoke our memory and honor.\nHerodotus (c. 484 – c. 425 BC), a Greek writer and geographer described\nas the “Father of History,” told the story of Solon and Croesus to\nillustrate Greek ideals surrounding death.\nCroesus, an enormously wealthy king of Lydia, was visited by Solon,\nan esteemed Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet who is now known as\none of the “Seven Wise Men of Greece.” Croesus wished to impress Solon\nwith his treasure and stature. He took Solon on a tour of his holdings\nand spoils of war. He wined and dined Solon in splendor for days.\nCroesus’s wealth was proverbial in the ancient world, in which people\nwould often exclaim that someone seemed “as rich as Croesus.”\nSeeking to be flattered, Croesus asked Solon who he thought was the\nhappiest man in the world. Solon’s answer disappointed Croesus, for it\nwasn’t Croesus. Solon identified three people who were happier than\nCroesus. One, Tellus, a simple Athenian farmer/statesman and two\nbrothers, Cleobis and Biton, who died young.\nSolon explained that Tellus was the happiest man he had ever known.\nTellus was a man of moderate means, certainly no match for the splendor\nof Croesus. Yet, Tellus lived in a well-governed country and raised\nvirtuous sons, all of whom produced grandchildren for Tellus to enjoy\nbecause they survived the perilous early years of childhood.\nOn top of these virtues, the end of Tellus’s life was most brilliant.\nWhen Athenians waged a war against their neighbors in Eleusis, Tellus\njoined the battle, fought valiantly, and helped rout the enemy — but\nlost his life. Tellus died gallantly in the service of his country.\nAccordingly, Athenians buried him publicly right where he fell in battle\nand honored him greatly. As Horace, a Roman lyric poet wrote in his\nOdes, Dulce et decorum est pro patria moria, or “It is\nsweet and fitting to die for the homeland.”\nCroesus failed to discern a difference between the idea of riches and\nthe idea of a more generalized good life. He seethed quietly in\njealousy. He concluded that Solon is mocking him subtly. Croesus asked\nSolon to continue by telling the story of the young boys, Cleobis and\nBiton, who Solon believed were happier than Croesus.\nThe brothers, who displayed singular athletic prowess and strength,\ndid not die gloriously in war. During a Greek festival honoring the\ngoddess Hera, their priestess mother was called for worship to the\ntemple devoted to the gods located some five miles away. When their\nmother’s team of oxen could not be located in the fields, the brothers\ntook up the yoke of their mother/priestess’s ceremonial wagon. They\npulled her wagon to the temple themselves so that their mother would not\nbe dishonored by arriving late to lead temple devotions.\nThe entire gathering at the temple saw the great love of the brothers\nfor their mother and their piety to the goddess Hera. Men stood around\nthe youths and congratulated them on their strength. Women congratulated\ntheir mother for having borne such children.\nThe mother of Cleobis and Biton was overjoyed at their feat and by\nthe praise they received. She stood before the image of the goddess Hera\nand prayed that the goddess might grant them whatever was best for\nmortal men.\nThe exhausted brothers feasted and slept that night in the temple,\nwaiting to take their mother home on the following day. But, they never\nrose again. Death held them there. Thanatos, the bringer of death,\nsnatched the brothers at the height of their powers, allowing them to\nevade the events that can fill almost every human life with some\nunhappiness. Their great deeds and devotion would ensure that the\nbrothers would be talked about long after their bones had turned into\ndust.\nThe Greeks, for whom the afterlife was a murky, aimless, dark place,\nbelieved that nothing is better for mortals than to die honorably –\nespecially honorably and young so as to be spared the\nvicissitudes of long life. As a quick glimpse into the Greek mind, so\ndifferent than ours, the mother of Cleobis and Biton thanked the goddess\nfor granting beautiful endings to the lives of her sons. As in A. E.\nHousman’s poem, To an Athlete Dying Young,\n\nNow you will not swell the rout /Of lads that wore their honours out\n/ Runners whom renown outran /And the name died before the man.\n\nCroesus could not understand why Tellus and the brothers, Cleobis and\nBiton, should be so honored. Weren’t they, as a modern leader once\nascribed to those who die in war, suckers (a word I select to paraphrase\nCroesus’s conclusion)? I guess that Croesus couldn’t see what was in it\nfor Tellus and the brothers. Croesus said, “No one is stupid enough to\nprefer war to peace; in peace sons bury their fathers and in war fathers\nbury their sons.” Wasn’t it better to ensure happiness in life, wondered\nCroesus, by building wealth and power?\nTo this, Solon replied that human life is largely a matter of chance.\nSomeone with vast wealth is no better off than someone who lives from\nday to day, unless good fortune attends him. Plenty of extremely wealthy\npeople are unfortunate, although plenty of people with moderate means\nare lucky.\nSolon said that if a person is protected by the chance of good luck,\navoids disfigurement and disease, has no experience of catastrophe, is\nblessed with fine children, and, in addition to all this, dies a good\ndeath, then that person deserves to be described as happy. Solon said,\n“Let no man be called happy before his death. Till then, he is not\nhappy, only lucky.”\nLater, Croesus himself was toppled by Cyrus, the King of Persia. No\ntreasures, no holdings, no power could save him from being burned alive\nby his captors. On his funeral pyre, as flames licked about him, Croesus\ncried, “Oh Solon! Oh Solon! Oh Solon! Count no man happy until the end\nis known!”\nThe probability of death for us all is 1.0….no doubt about that fact.\nWe all will die. Marcus Aurelius wrote in one of the most withering\nlines in his diary that “Alexander the Great and his mule driver both\ndied.” In the end, the most powerful conqueror on earth was, Aurelius\nimplied, no better or no less mortal than the man who drove his baggage\ncart. Moreover, death’s timing is mostly unknown to us. The best\nopportunity for virtuous action in our lives is now, not at some vague\nlater time.\nAnd, to sharpen our daily quest for virtue, we must remember that a\nfinal material or spiritual accounting at death for a life’s impact does\nnot just happen to some abstract “others.” But, instead, death may visit\nus so near as to be among our friends and even our family members whom\nwe hold dear – and, yes, in a thin ribbon of a moment, to us,\nourselves.\nFor the most part, we are likely to know the objective facts of\ndeaths — location, circumstances, causes. Understanding the thoughts,\nfeelings, or awareness of others at the time of their deaths is\ndifficult to estimate, though. We, as a result, remember only the facts\nand meanings that we assign to lives and deaths. These remembrances form\nthe basis of our memorials.\nAbout the dead, though, we know nothing about the unfathomably deep\nor boundless space in which they might exist. We display our own sense\nof virtue when we remember and honor the dead who have rounded their\nlives in service to larger ideals and have paid with their lives for\nthese efforts. And, that, for me, is a good enough reason for Memorial\nDay.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:31:05 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

Just\nwait until a bunch of the sun is flung at the Earth!,” Pennsylvania\nBusiness Central, 18(10), p. 7, 15 May 2009.\n\nDraw the shades, and douse the lights. Cue the dark, creepy music.\nBoil the sky with black scudding storm clouds. Feel a damp chill as the\nspine tingles.\nThis is a scary story.\nDuring the late summer of 1859, astronomers noted that the sun\nespecially was active. On September 1, Richard Carrington, a British\nastronomer, observed an extremely large solar flare, a giant,\nenergy–releasing explosion on the sun’s surface. This flare ejected a\nlarge mass of geomagnetic plasma, consisting primarily of electrons and\nprotons, toward the Earth.\nWithin eighteen hours, the Earth experienced the largest\never–recorded geomagnetic storm. Skies worldwide erupted in red, green,\nand purple auroras (“northern lights”) so brilliant that newspapers\ncould be read as easily during the night as in the day. Auroras lit the\nskies so brightly in the Rocky Mountains that the glow woke gold miners,\nwho began cooking breakfast because they thought it was morning.\nTelegraph systems went wild. Electrical discharges shocked telegraph\noperators and started fires. Even when telegraphers disconnected\nbatteries powering telegraph lines, electrical currents induced in the\nwires by the solar event still allowed messages to be transmitted.\nA rare event? Maybe so, but severe solar storms have had large\nconsequences for the Earth.\nSolar storms have been disruptive in the U.S. already. For example, a\nhuge solar flare on August 4, 1972, knocked out long–distance telephone\ncommunication across Illinois. A similar flare on March 13, 1989,\ndisrupted electric power transmission from a Hydro Québec generating\nstation in Canada, blacking out most of the province and plunging 6\nmillion people into darkness for 9 hours. Power surges from this\ngeomagnetic storm even melted power transformers in New Jersey. The same\nstorm caused the atmosphere to inflate and, as a result, dragged a Long\nDuration Exposure Facility satellite studying extraterrestrial radiation\nexposure to a lower orbital height. In December 2005, a solar storm\ndisrupted satellite–to–ground communications and Global Positioning\nSystem navigation signals for about 10 minutes.\nOur complex and interconnected modern infrastructure depends\nincreasingly on a functioning electrical grid and electrical devices.\nInfrastructure for communications, electrical power, water, banking,\nfinance, and transportation sectors, to name a few, are highly\ninterdependent, as shown in a figure shown at the bottom of this article\nfrom a report by the Department of Homeland Security. A National Research Council\nreport on the social and economic impacts of severe space weather\nevents, indicated that a replication of the solar storm first\nobserved by Carrington would result in extensive, and possibly\ncatastrophic, social and economic disruptions.\nAccording to the NRC report, a severe space weather event in the U.S.\ncould induce ground currents that would destroy 300 key transformers\nwithin about 90 seconds after a solar pulse reached the Earth, cutting\noff power for more than 130 million people. According to a NRC map, Pennsylvania, along with\nthe entire northeastern U.S., particularly is vulnerable. In fact, NRC\nestimates that 55% of Pennsylvania transformers are at risk.\nPotable water would go first. Pumped water would stop. Without\nelectricity pumping water from reservoirs, water through taps would\ncease in four hours. No electrically powered transport would function.\nDelivery trucks would run out of fuel, with no electricity to pump gas\nfrom underground tanks at filling stations. Back–up generators would\nlast until their fuel ran out. Hospitals could provide about 72 hours of\nslim, essential care. After that, modern healthcare, as we know it,\nwould end.\nNatural gas and fuel pipelines require electricity to operate.\nCoal–fired power stations usually keep reserves to last 30 days. After\nthat, no electricity. Grid failure would trigger programmed shut–down of\nnuclear power stations.\nPeople would die. Power loss would cripple major centers of\npharmaceutical production. The supply of perishable medications, such as\ninsulin, would be exhausted quickly.\nRestoration of service would take a shockingly long time. Months.\nMaybe years. Replacement, not repair, of melted transformer hubs would\nbe required. Replacement transformers, and the crews for installations,\nare scarce. Spare transformers would be used quickly. Production of\nreplacements could take 12 months. Transportation of new transformers to\nsites would become a nightmare.\nAccording to the NRC report, the impact of a “severe geomagnetic\nstorm scenario” could be as high as $2 trillion in the first year after\nthe storm, which is many times the costs resulting from Hurricane\nKatrina. The NRC estimates recovery time between four to 10 years and\nquestions whether the U.S. economy could recover completely.\nWith enough warning (no less than 15 minutes), electrical utilities\ncould harden for an incoming solar pulse. However, satellites that form\nthe current early warning system are aged and becoming unreliable.\nThe installation of supplemental transformer neutral ground resistors\nin critical locations throughout the U.S. could reduce anticipated\ndamage from a solar storm’s wallop by 60% to 70%. The expected costs of\nthe relatively easy installation of these refrigerator–sized devices are\napproximately $150 billion, which sounds like a pretty good bargain in\nour current bailout economy.\nYet, serious scientists can barely stir a yawn when they discuss the\npreparations for and consequences of severe solar events.\nThe sun’s activity level rises and falls in approximately eleven–year\nwaves. The next solar sunspot and flare maximum is expected in 2012.\nAnyone have sunscreen, bottled water, and a pet dog (they can be tasty,\nif prepared well) that they are willing to share?\nInfratructure is connected densely:\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:36:50 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

    "contents": "\nA young friend held up a paperback copy of Moby-Dick, Herman\nMelville’s epic allegorical novel about the voyage of the whaling ship,\nthe Pequod, the ship’s variegated crew, and its tyrannical\nCaptain Ahab and their pursuit of the great, ferocious white sperm\nwhale, Moby Dick. Captain Ahab drives his harpooners and mates to kill\nMoby Dick, to whom Ahab had lost a leg in an earlier encounter.\n\nStarbuck, the thought-filled first mate of the Pequod, and other\nmembers of his crew – Stubb and Flask, most notably – are joined by the\n“savage cannibal,” Queequeg, and other harpooners – a native American,\nTashtego, a giant African, Daggoo, and the sinister Persian, Fedallah –\njoin to fulfill Ahab’s single-minded, obsessive desire to destroy the\nGreat White. Moby-Dick begins with its fictional narrator’s famous line,\n“Call me Ishmael,” perhaps one of the most famous openings in American\nliterature.\nMy young friend’s paperback volume did not seem quite thick enough\nfor the original. Melville’s book is a long work that often is abridged\nfor young and modern readers. In its virgin form, Moby-Dick is\npeppered with what seem now to be odd sailing terms and references to\nthe sensibilities of 1850s seafaring, making the manuscript certainly\nchallenging slogging for most of the dot.com generation and for anyone\naccustomed to maintaining any more than the one-hour-and-out attention\nspan required to watch a History Channel treatment of a topic. No, the\nactual Moby-Dick is difficult for most young readers even to\ncarry, let alone read.\nMelville had extensive experience at sea. He served as a cabin boy,\nas a seaman on the frigate United States, as a harpooner out of\nNantucket, Massachusetts, and as a member of the crew on a whaling ship,\nAcushnet, in the South Seas from which he reported jumped ship\nand lived among native people for three years. Yet, with all the fog and\nfoam conjured on its pages, Moby-Dick was written in\nland-locked western Massachusetts from Melville’s knowledge and\nexperience with the sea and whaling.\nAs he wrote Moby-Dick, I feel sure Melville had to create\nscenes, dialog, and a flow as though the whole story was played out in\nfront of him. In the green hills around Pittsford, Massachusetts, the\nonly water of significance would result from drops on the trees and\nthrough the little dales in cool emergent spring, during languid summer\nafternoons, and on magnificent, dappled fall’s canvass of spent life\nwaiting for the first frost. So far from the vast green sea, without the\nrolling dark waves, without the briny smell of boiling seawater pressed\noutward by the prow of the ship, Melville wrote such passages as in\nChapter 51, The Spirit-Spout,\n\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\nsilence, not a solitude: on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\nthe sea.\n\nOr, as in Chapter 111, The Pacific,\n\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose\ngently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like\nthose fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist\nSt. John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling\nwatery prairies and Potter’s Fields of all four continents, the waves\nshould rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions\nof mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries;\nall that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing\nlike slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by\ntheir restlessness.\n\nOr, in Chapter 132, The Symphony,\n\nIt was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\ntransparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s\nchest in his sleep.\n\nIf you can read these passages without hearing the sign-song creak of\nthe mast, without smelling the new and old life and death in the sea\nparted by the ship, without feeling in the palm of your tar-stained hand\nthe snag of a sliver from the deck rail, or without seeing in your long\ngaze the gentle curve of the horizon melding with the infinite, without\nrocking to the pitch and yaw of the ship as it charges in a wild reach,\nthen you just might not be concentrating.\n\nPerhaps the secret to penetrating what seems to us as turgid prose\nfrom a long-gone era is to actually make Moby-Dick with\nMelville, not merely read it. Although Melville put down his pen as he\nfinished writing his signature work almost 160 years ago, Moby-Dick is\nnew to us and occurs again as we read it…every time we read it. This is\nthe magic and sacredness of books that no film could ever hope to match,\nno matter what budget or artistry is behind it. Every time we read and\nre-read a book, the story is told with fresh, new meaning because the\nstory is not a story with meaning to us until we imagine and fill in the\ncracks with our own thoughts, colors, smells, and textures. In this way,\nno one reads Moby-Dick in the same way as any other person. In\nfact, like some sort of Alzheimer’s patients, we read a book differently\nevery time we encounter it.\nSo, my advice, my dear young friend: read Moby-Dick without\nworrying about finishing it, no matter what your teacher requires. Buy\nthe unabridged version. Savor the words. Build the story in your mind’s\neye. Enjoy the poetry of it all. For one day, you will have a Great\nWhite of your own to slay, when the deep moans ’round with many voices,\nwhen you will need already to have had practice with the reckless\npursuit of demons without a thought for your own peril.\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:11:12 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.

He\nhad a great story to tell that he initially published in\nFastCompany (Issue 82 May 2004, Page 103) and that is available\nat his website:\n\nA Buddhist parable illustrates the challenge – and value - of letting\ngo of the past. Two monks were strolling by a stream on their way home\nto the monastery. They were startled by the sound of a young woman in a\nbridal gown, sitting by the stream, crying softly. Tears rolled down her\ncheeks as she gazed across the water. She needed to cross to get to her\nwedding, but she was fearful that doing so might ruin her beautiful\nhandmade gown.\n\n\nIn this particular sect, monks were prohibited from touching women.\nBut one monk was filled with compassion for the bride. Ignoring the\nsanction, he hoisted the woman on his shoulders and carried her across\nthe stream–assisting her journey and saving her gown. She smiled and\nbowed with gratitude as he noisily splashed his way back across the\nstream to rejoin his companion.\n\n\nThe second monk was livid. “How could you do that?” he scolded. “You\nknow we are forbidden even to touch a woman, much less pick one up and\ncarry her around!”\n\n\nThe offending monk listened in silence to a stern lecture that lasted\nall the way back to the monastery. His mind wandered as he felt the warm\nsunshine and listened to the singing birds. After returning to the\nmonastery, he fell asleep for a few hours. He was jostled and awakened\nin the middle of the night by his fellow monk. “How could you carry that\nwoman?” his agitated friend cried out. “Someone else could have helped\nher across the stream. You were a bad monk!”\n\n\n“What woman?” the tired monk inquired groggily.\n\n\n“Don’t you even remember? That woman you carried across the stream,”\nhis colleague snapped.\n\n\n“Oh, her,” laughed the sleepy monk. “I only carried her across the\nstream. You carried her all the way back to the monastery.”\n\nThe learning point is simple: Leave it at the stream.\n\nLast updated on\n\n[1] \"2022-04-22 06:08:57 EDT\"\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/davidpassmore/blog, unless otherwise\nnoted.
