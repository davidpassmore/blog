*This article is my follow-up to my August 2022 essay about uses of
information markets in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race
[@passmore2022a].*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an August 2022 essay in NOTES FROM PITTSBURGH [@passmore2022], I
described the use of information markets in place of survey methods for
identifying candidate preferences of the electorate. Information markets
operate like commodity and financial futures markets, except that the
"commodity" traded in a contract is a written proposition, not a
physical good. Information markets trade contracts for propositions
about whether well-specified events will occur and when.

The basis of an information market is a contract for a written
proposition, the truth of which is validated at a specific future date.
Contract prices range between zero and \$1. The price the buyer of a
contract is willing to pay represents the buyer's belief in the
fulfillment of the proposition when the market closes at some future
date. Market participants typically buy and sell contracts using an
electronic exchange.

In this article, I describe how an information market tracked an abrupt
change of fortunes in campaigns run by two candidates for a single seat
in the U.S. Senate for Pennsylvania.

### Election for U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania: Fetterman & Oz

#### The Midterms

The 2022 Pennsylvania midterm race for U.S. Senate has garnered national
attention (see, e.g., [@glueck2022]). The race pits John Fetterman, a
Democrat, against Mehmet Oz, a Republican. Fetterman serves as the 34th
lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. A midterm election---so-named
because it occurs in the middle of a U.S. president's four-year
term---is held to elect candidates to the U.S. Congress and state and
local public offices. The U.S. will hold its next midterm election on 8
November 2022, after a string of primary elections and run-offs narrowed
the field of candidates. As I write this article on October 31, 2022,
campaigning continues at a fever pitch.

#### Front-Running Candidates

Fetterman was mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, from 2006 to 2019. Oz is
a Turkish--American television personality, author, professor emeritus
at Columbia University, and retired cardiothoracic surgeon. He is the
first Muslim to be nominated by either major political party for U.S.
Senate. The outcome of this race could have a profound impact on the
balance of power in the U.S. Senate and stands as a test of the efficacy
of endorsements for office by former U.S. president Donald Trump.

### Initial Preferences: Fetterman Over Oz

As of 18 August 2022, PredictIt [@predictit2022a], a project of Victoria
University located in Wellington, New Zealand, had been running an
online information market for 181 days to obtain bets about the outcome
of the Fetterman v Oz race [@predictit2022b]. My August 2022 essay
described the technical details about this information market. However,
reported in that essay was the overwhelming and expanding lead that
Fetterman, the Democrat, had over Oz, the Republican, as demonstrated in
the price-volume plot in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr).

```{r img-volpr, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body-outset", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*90-day price-volume plot for* "Which party will win the U.S. Senate election <br/> in Pennsylvania in 2022?" *in PredictIt political market.* on 18 August 2022 <br> (Image from Predictit [-@predictit2022c].)'}

```

### Inversion of Preferences: Oz Over Fetterman

#### The Flip

Shown in the plot in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr1), including 90 days
prior to 30 October 2022, is the inversion of preferences for *Fetterman
over Oz* to *Oz over Fetterman* that occurred on 19 October 2022. And,
the strength of preference for Oz continued from that day and increased
until 30 October 2022.

```{r img-volpr1, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body-outset", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*90-day price-volume plot for* "Which party will win the U.S. Senate election <br/> in Pennsylvania in 2022?" *in PredictIt political market.* on 30 October 2022 <br> (Image from Predictit [-@predictit2022c].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/fetozinv.png")
```

#### Initial Reaction Leading to the Flip

Fetterman reportedly suffered an ischemic stroke on 31 May 2022
[@avril2022]. An ischemic stroke involves a blockage in one of the large
vessels that supplies oxygenated blood to the brain. Fetterman's team
announced that the stroke had caused no cognitive damage, assured voters
that Fetterman would resume campaigning soon, and believed that the
episode would not affect preferences for Fetterman over Oz [@terruso].
The price-volume plot in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr1) seems to
demonstrate Fetterman's hold on the electorate's preferences, despite
lingering questions about his long-term recovery and complications from
his stroke.

#### Things Happened

##### Interview

Surveys of the electorate began to show a tightening of the race between
Fetterman and Oz in October [@drey2022]. Oz, Fetterman's opponent, and
the public demanded for months greater transparency from Fetterman about
his health challenges. A significant event negatively affecting
Fetterman's campaign was an 11 October 2022 interview with NBC News's
Dasha Burns [@fetterman], who wrote that Fetterman struggled to speak
and "had trouble finding words [@burns2022]." In addition, Burns said:

> We had a monitor set up so that he could read my questions because he
> still has lingering auditory processing issues as a result of the
> stroke, which means he has a hard time understanding what he's
> hearing. Now, once he reads the question he's able to understand,
> you'll hear he also still has some problems, some challenges with
> speech.
>
> "Just in some of the small talk prior to the interview, before the
> closed captioning was up and running, it did seem that he had a hard
> time understanding our conversation. I've spoken with stroke experts,
> they say folks can fully recover from that, but the caveat that every
> expert gives is that they can't fully assess a patient without details
> on their health records, without that information that the campaign
> has yet to disclose. We've asked multiple times for medical records,
> we've asked for interviews with someone from his medical team, those
> requests have so far been denied to NBC News and other outlets that
> have requested this as well.

##### Medical Report

Burns and Allen [-@burns2022a]reported that Democrats stated concerns
about Fetterman's recovery and whether he had been forthcoming about his
health. After considerable pressure on the Fetterman campaign, on 15
October 2022 Fetterman's primary care physician released a letter
[@chen2022] summarizing his opinion of Fetterman's condition. Chen
wrote:

> Overall, the Lt. Governor is recovering well from his stroke....He
> spoke intelligently without cognitive deficits. His speech was normal
> and he continues to exhibit symptoms of an auditory processing
> disorder which can come across as hearing difficulty. Occasional words
> he will "miss" which seems like he doesn't hear the word but it is
> actually not processed properly. His hearing of sound such as music is
> not affected....He has no work restrictions and can work full duty in
> public office.

Skeptics pointed out that Dr. Chen was a donor to Fetterman's campaign,
posing a challenge to the standards and integrity of a physician working
for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [@sabes2022].

##### Debate

On 25 October 2022, Fetterman and Oz met for one hour for their one and
only debate [@gomez2022]. Some journalists complained that the debate
amounted to a bullying of Fetterman for the difficulties left by his
stroke [@lanum2022]. Yet, Fetterman's performance seemed for many to
reinforce questions about his stroke recovery. Democrats interviewed
after the debate were shocked by the degree to which Fetterman struggled
to communicate clearly, even though he has acknowledged the ongoing
difficulty processing what he hears and speaking without dropping words
[@gomez2022a]. One voter interviewed after the debate said

> I felt almost bad for John Fetterman. I think there is no question
> that his social media campaign has been very sharp and good and
> appealing, but when he got on the debate stage, I couldn't really
> understand a lot of the points he was making. On the other side, I
> thought Oz looked pretty sharp. Sounded like a politician. I don't
> know that Fetterman was really able to convey many of his positions on
> issues. [@kornick2022]

### The Information Market Tracked the Flip of Preferences

#### Timing

The Predictit information market for the Fetterman-Oz race reacted to
events after Fetterman's stroke. As displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-volpr1), the contract price for Oz spiked upward, and
Fetterman's price dropped after the 11 October 2022 Burns interview with
Fetterman. The rose of Oz and the decline of Fetterman continued until
18 October 2022---three days after the Fetterman medical report
dropped---when Oz overtook Fetterman. Fetterman and Oz continued to
diverge, drawing closer on the day of the debate but moving to a wide,
open-jawed lead of Oz over Fetterman starting the day after the debate.
Almost 260,000 contracts were traded in this Predictit market on the day
of the debate.

#### Market Movements: Traders Bought Oz and Sold Fetterman

Shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-oxc) is a candle plot of the seven days of
trading of Oz contracts prior to and including 30 October 2022. One
hundred thirty-five thousand contracts were traded in the day of the
debate. The price of an Oz share started trading at 53 cents, but closed
at 65 cents. The price rose to 68 cents on 30 October 2022.

```{r img-oxc, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body-outset", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*7-day price-volume candle plot for* "Which party will win the U.S. Senate election <br/> in Pennsylvania in 2022?" *in PredictIt political market.* on 30 October 2022 <br> (Image from Predictit [-@predictit2022c].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/ozcandle.png")
```

The candle plot in Figure \@ref(fig:img-fetc) shows the precipitous fall
in the price of Fetterman contracts. The price of a Fetterman share
declined from 50 cents to 39 cents on the day of the Fetterman-Oz
debate. After three days of slight declines, the Fetterman price share
settled at 38 cents on 30 October. People made up their minds, it seems,
right after the debate. On 25 October 2022, 116,000 Fetterman shares
were traded, most likely as sales. Then, the next three days saw a small
volume of trades.

## My Limits {.appendix}

In this article, I stick with the data from the Predictit market, *Which
party will win the U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania in 2022?*
[@predictit2022c]. I do not consider Fetterman's fitness for office
based on his health condition. Also, I do not comment on the ethics of
what many observers describe as "ableism" [@bogart2019] enacted by Oz's
supporters to denigrate Fetterman's fitness for office.
