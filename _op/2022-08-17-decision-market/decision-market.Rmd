*[Estimated reading time: 28 minutes]*

Today is 18 August 2022. As I started writing this essay, the U.S. was
the season for political campaigns meant to inform and persuade the
electorate before the midterm elections---called the "midterms" because
they occur in the middle of a U.S. president's four-year term---are held
to elect people to the U.S. Congress and state and local public offices.
The U.S. will hold its next midterm election on 8 November 2022, after a
string of primary elections and run-offs to narrow the field of
candidates.

Obtaining information about beliefs, opinions, and voting preferences
before the midterm elections is crucial for many reasons. This
information can guide campaign strategy. Also, campaign donors can
receive signals from this information about candidates' worthiness for
continuing financial or moral support. This information can further
focus the mission for campaign workers and can validate the effort
behind their commitment to candidates. Moreover, when candidates display
public support, voter attention is drawn to candidates and their deeper
bios.

In this blog posting, I focus the use of information markets for
obtaining in place of survey methods for identifying candidate
preferences of the electorate.[^1] Information markets operate in the
same way as commodity and financial futures markets, except that the
commodity traded in contracts is information, not a physical good.
Information markets trade contracts for propositions about whether
events will occur and when.

[^1]: See the appendix to this blog posting, "My Approach to the Topic
    of This Posting," for my motivations for writing this essay.

The mission for this blog posting is to describe concepts and processes
to apply commodity and financial futures markets to structure
information markets for estimating candidate preferences of the
electorate. In the remainder of this posting, I offer some examples of
information markets to demonstrate their applications to diverse
questions that also could be answered using survey methods. But, first,
to set the stage, I contrast the two approaches---survey methods *v*
information markets---for estimating beliefs about the outcome of a
Pennsylvania political race for the U.S. Senate that will be decided in
a November 2022 midterm.

## *Fetterman* v *Oz:* Two Approaches to Estimating Voter Preferences

The 2022 Pennsylvania midterm race for U.S. Senate is garnering national
attention (see, e.g., @glueck2022). John Fetterman, a Democrat, is
pitted against Mehmet Oz, a Republican. Fetterman serves as the 34th
lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. He was mayor of Braddock,
Pennsylvania, from 2006 to 2019. Oz is a Turkish--American television
personality, author, professor emeritus at Columbia University, and
retired cardiothoracic surgeon. He is the first Muslim to be nominated
by either major political party for U.S. Senate. The outcome of this
race could have profound impact on the balance of power in the U.S.
Senate and stands as a test of the efficacy of endorsements for office
by former U.S. president Donald Trump. I describe two alternatives for
estimating beliefs about the outcome of the Fetterman *v* Oz race for
for Senate: one uses survey methods and the other uses of information
markets.

### Estimation Using Survey Methods

#### [@walter1999]17 August 2022 Preference

As of 17 August 2022, Fetterman is favored by respondents by 11.1% over
Oz (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-poll1)). This estimate is based on a
weighted average percent favoring candidate from a number of polls
[@silver2008a].[^2]

[^2]: Data for all Senate races in the U.S. are available from
    @fivethirtyeight.com2022. I extracted data pertaining solely to
    Pennsylvania and made these state data available for download in a
    [.cvs
    file](https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/files/infomark/PA_senate_polls.csv).

```{r img-poll1, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body-outset", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Lead by Fetterman over Oz in averaged survey findings in fivethirtyeight.com on 17 August 2022.* <br> (Image from @best2022.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/poll1.png")
```

Methods for surveys are richly varied and well-documented (see, e.g.,
workflows by Fink [-@fink2015], Kelley, et al. [-@kelley2003], and
Walter et al. [-@walter1999a] ) , and, therefore, I will not restate
them here. In brief, though, a sample of respondents are recruited from
a population of interest to answer questions. Estimates of responses in
the population are inferred from responses in the sample, with a band of
confidence around the estimates reflecting the possibility of
differences between the population parameters and the estimates from the
sample. Analysts attempt to account for response and non-response errors
and biases in the estimates.

#### Survey Project Management

In the fivethirtyeight.com estimates multiple independent surveys of the
relative preference for the two candidates were averaged over different
survey vendors and time periods to provide a meta-estimate of the status
of the Fetterman *v* Oz race. (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-poll2) for
examples of selected surveys in the fivethirtyeight.com analysis). Each
one of the surveys averaged by fivethirtyeight.com represents a separate
project with a work plan for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and
reporting derived information. Logistical impediments and added costs in
using surveys can result from the complexity and cycle time necessary to
complete survey projects and from the need to report survey findings to
fit time-sensitive strategic information needs and time-limited media
attention.

```{r img-poll2, echo=FALSE, layout="l-page", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Selected findings from Fetterman* v *Oz survey findings averaged by fivethirtyeight.com* <br> (Image from @best2022.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/poll2.png")
```

Implementation of professionally--produced surveys can require extensive
budgeting for, among other elements, survey design, staffing, respondent
recruitment, and perhaps establishing effective incentives to motivate
to survey responses *each time a survey is conducted*. Increasing the
the size of the respondent sample can balloon costs as can require
design of complex survey questions that branch the flows of questions
conditional on criteria for segmenting respondents (e.g., "If you are
married and a home owner, skip to Q23."). Implementation of survey
methods can draw on significant resources as a campaign progresses.

### Estimation Using an Information Market

#### The Fetterman *v* Oz Market

The basis of an information market is contract for a written
proposition, the truth of which is validated at a specific future date.
Contracts prices range between zero and \$1. The price the buyer of a
contract is willing to pay represents the buyer's belief in the
fulfillment of the proposition when the market closes at a future date.

On 18 August 2022, *PredictIt*, a project of Victoria University located
in Wellington, New Zealand [@predictit2022], had been running an
information market for 181 days to obtain bets about the outcome of the
Fetterman *v* Oz race, which is a comparison similar to the assessment
conducted by fivethirtyeight.com that is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-poll1). Criteria for assessing the fulfillment of the
proposition in the PredictIt market are reproduced in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-rules).

```{r img-rules, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body-outset", fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Rules for judging the outcome of* "Which party will win the U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania in 2022?" *in PredictIt political market.* <br> (Image from Best et. al [-@best2022a.] on 17 August 2011 @ 12:19 pm.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/Fetterman_rules.png")
```

#### Trading in the PredictIt Exchange

Here is how trading in the Fetterman *v* Oz information futures market
works in PredictIt:

```{=html}
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#ececec; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
```
::: blue
-   A buyer may purchase as many contracts as desired.
-   Individual contract prices vary from zero to \$1.
-   Owners of contracts either may sell or hold their contracts.
-   The prices of "Yes" and "No" contracts always are complementary.
    That is, The "Yes" and "No" prices must sum to \$1.
-   A buyer may offer any price; the seller may accept or reject any
    price.
-   The market price paid for a contract is conceptualized as the
    probability that the proposition will eventuate by market closing.
-   In this particular binary ("Yes" or "No") proposition, a buyer
    selects one of four options to purchase a contract -
    -   for Fetterman to win (meaning Oz will lose)\
    -   for Fetterman to lose (meaning Oz will win)\
    -   for Oz to win (meaning Fetterman will lose)\
    -   for Oz to lose (meaning Fetterman will win)
:::

<br/> Markets other than for binary outcomes are available For example,
markets allowing selection from a range of outcomes are possible.
PredictIt closed on 24 May 2022 a market in which participants bought
contracts on the percentage of the popular vote cast in favor of John
Fetterman in the 2022 Pennsylvania Democratic primary election for U.S.
Senate on 7 May 2022 (see @predictit2022a for prices at the close of the
market). Other complex forms of markets can include joint outcome.
Although PredictIt does not offer such a market, participants could
construct propositions that include, for example, the likelihood that of
favoring a particular gubernatorial candidate *and* favoring Fetterman
for the Senate.

#### 18 August 2022 Share Prices

Shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-daym) are the market prices on 17 August
2022 for the proposition, *Which party will win the U.S. Senate
election* <br> in Pennsylvania in 2022?. The market price for 17 August
indicated a strong belief that Fetterman will beat Oz in the race by the
closing date for the market, much stronger than in the difference
estimated by survey methods (refer, again, to Figure
\@ref(fig:img-poll1)).

```{r img-daym, echo=FALSE,  fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", out.width='100%', fig.cap='*Market price for* "Which party will win the U.S. Senate election <br> in Pennsylvania in 2022?"  *in PredictIt political market.* <br> (Image from Best et. al [-@best2022a.] on 17 August 2011 @ 12:19 pm.)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/Fetterman_daymarket.png")
```

Estimates based on survey methods and information markets are not fully
equivalent. For instance, The survey-based estimates are averaged from
responses to questions that, in general, request a preference among
candidates. The estimate from the information market requires prediction
of which candidate will win the race, conditional on information
aggregated by the market participant from a variety of points of
information about candidate prospects. For the most part, the
survey-based approaches rely on which candidate you like, while the
estimates from the information market focus on who will win, regardless
of who the market participant favors. Respondents to surveys generally
have no pecuniary stake in the outcome of the race, while information
market participants placed money (albeit a small stake) on their bet.

This market has a "winner--take--all" reward. When the market closes,
holder of a contract for the winning share will receive \$1, and holder
of the losing share will receive nothing. Buyers and sellers can engage
in a variety of trading strategies based on information they discover
about the race:

-   A buyer could bet on a winner to make money when the market closes.
    If so, a strategy is to get in the market while the price is low and
    hold it as it soars (you hope and, indeed, bet) to market closing.\
-   A buyer could bet on a candidate with a current low market price if
    the buyer believes that candidate's fortunes will turn just enough
    to raise an acceptable return on investment---"buy low, sell high."\
-   Or, maybe a buyer bets on the winner of this race, even if the buyer
    are unconcerned about the political outcome, as a hedge against a
    risky bet in another market.\
    -A buyer could engage in arbitrage because the market has not
    reacted quickly to changes in information about the race or is just
    not paying attention to information that signals a change in
    fortunes. This approach involves buying when the buyer believes that
    the market price is artificially low or high. The buyer could reap a
    quick reward by selling originally undervalued contracts at the
    market price to newly informed investors. When the market
    artificially is too high the buyer could buy contracts for a
    discount from sellers holding contracts with high-than-rational
    price who are eager to exit the market before experiencing more
    price erosion.

#### Price-Volume Chart

Displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr) is a plot following the price
of market shares and the volume of shared over a 90-day period. The
trajectory of the market price shows how beliefs about the outcome of
the Fetterman *v* Oz race changed over time. Notice that beliefs that Oz
would win the race in the month after Fetterman announced a health
condition (a stroke). Then, Fetterman reversed this trend and continued
to widen the gap with Oz.

Tracked in each vertical bar on the plot in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr)
is the volume of shares traded in each of the 90 days. High volume days
indicate interest in the proposition represented in the contract. A
surge in trading occurred on 15 June, perhaps as concerns about
Fetterman's health began to wane. The volume of trades rose near the
date Fox News reported that Fetterman agrees with a plan to cut the
prison population by one-third [@chasmar2022]. A surge in trading
happened, raising Fetterman's market price, around the date that
Breitbart syndicated information about Fetterman's call for heavy fines
against airlines for flight cancellations [@dixon-hamilton2022].

My attributions of reasons behind volume surges in the Fetterman *v* Oz
market obviously are ad hoc and speculative. However, a serious campaign
analyst could track and explain how campaign activities, media buzz,
candidate gaffs and peccadilloes, and buzz about candidates affect
beliefs about the outcome of a political race.

## Commodity Futures and Information Markets Are in the Same Family

### General Features of Commodities Futures Markets

#### Commodities

A futures contract is:

> a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity asset, or
> security at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.
> Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to
> facilitate trading on a futures exchange. [@hayes2021]

For example, a buyer might purchase a contract for delivery of 5,000
bushels of No. 2 Yellow Corn [@agcommodities2022] on the following March
1 for \$3.82 per bushel. The buyer of a futures contract takes on the
obligation to buy and receive the underlying asset when the futures
contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the
obligation to provide and deliver the underlying asset at the expiration
date.

Buyers of futures contracts typically are investors, not producers.
Buyers usually sell their interest in a commodity to a producer before
the commodity is delivered.[^3] A clearing corporation brokers trading
of futures contracts by acting as a single counter-party to every
transaction and by guaranteeing the completion and credit-worthiness of
all transactions. PredictIt is the clearing corporation for contracts
such as the Fetterman *v* Oz contract in the PredictIt information
market.

[^3]: Can you imagine investors living is a shady, residential
    neighborhoods having 5,000 bushels of corn dumped in their front
    yards on the delivery date specified in their contracts?

Commodities include mostly raw, unprocessed goods that are bought on the
basis of price alone in large quantities for future processing. The U.S.
government defines commodities in the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act
[@legalinformationinstitute2022]. Commodities are classified in three
major categories: agriculture, energy, and metals. The most popular
futures markets for food are for meat, wheat, and sugar. Most energy
futures are in oil and gasoline markets. Metals using futures markets
include gold, silver, and copper. The 1936 Act also governs financial
products (e.g., future values of interest rates, currencies, stock
indexes, bonds, or equity and debt options) as though they were
commodities. Buyers of food, energy, and metal use futures contracts to
fix the price of the commodity they are purchasing. That reduces their
risk that prices will go up. Sellers of these commodities use futures to
guarantee that they will receive the agreed-upon price. They remove the
risk of a price drop.

Buyers and sellers reach a contact price based on current information
aggregated about the future value of a commodity. Useful information
could include forecasts of possible commodity prices, impacts of war or
weather on the quality and quantity of a commodity, government
regulations that affect the structure or operation of commodity product
or resource markets, or regional or world-wide macroeconomic trends
affecting those markets. Prices of commodities change on a weekly or
even daily basis, dictating frequent changes in consumer prices of
meats, gasoline, and gold. For instance, PJM Interconnection LLC
[@pjm2022a][^4] applies hourly-- [@pjmdataminer2022] and day--ahead
[@pjmdataminer2022a] markets used to balance transmission of electric
power among electricity users.

[^4]: A regional transmission organization in the United States that
    coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in 13 of the
    United States and the District of Columbia.

#### Information aggregation and price discovery

Futures markets not only provide practical trading opportunities, but
they also demonstrate some interesting and useful qualities for
information aggregation (see Hull [-@hull2016a] for a review of the
operations of futures markets). Economists have long held the belief
that markets efficiently collect and disseminate information about goods
and services as prices necessary to satisfy both buyers and sellers are
discovered. Hayek [-@hayek1945] generated the hypothesis that, through
the price discovery process, markets aggregate the less--than--perfect,
diverse information widely dispersed among individual traders and
disseminate this information to all traders.

The so--called "Hayek Hypothesis" has empirical support from a series of
experiments that have illustrated the dissemination of knowledge from
the informed to the uninformed as well as the full aggregation of
knowledge among partially informed bidders (@plott2000 contains a review
and summary of the experimental research). Also, the economic theory of
rational expectations, originating with Muth [-@muth1961] and most
closely associated with Lucas [-@licas1987], not only acknowledges the
information aggregation capacity of markets, but it also the ability of
markets to convey information through the price and volume of assets
traded.

The information aggregation mechanism first identified by Hayek suggests
that markets are the final arbiters of value and that markets provide an
excellent method for harnessing knowledge distributed across their
participants. Plott and Chen [-@plott2002] asserted that business pages
of newspapers almost daily interpret market behavior as an aggregation
of information about future events. Markets are thought to anticipate
events such as changes in price inflation, shifts in federal monetary
policy, or prospects for disruptive events like war or labor stoppages.
Plott and Chen [-@plott2002] further suggested that,

> Reflecting on every day notions about the way that people learn from
> observing other people can form a common sense impression of how an
> aggregation mechanism might work. For example....if a crowd is
> observed looking at something then there is a propensity for
> additional people to look. The actions of the crowd suggest they know
> something and others instinctively incorporate this possibility into
> their own information base...."Insiders," those with bits and pieces
> of information, those with good "intuition" about events are
> registering their beliefs through their actions in the markets. That
> is,...the markets are like a vacuum sweeper, collecting and
> aggregating information that is otherwise highly decentralized and
> privately held. (pp. 2--3)

#### Investment goals

A contract holder sells a commodity to producers at the market price
current at the time of delivery. The difference between the price of a
commodity when a futures contract was purchased and its market price on
the date of delivery equals a gain or a loss for the investor. Traders
in future markets are motivated by at least three goals:

-   *profit and speculation*---exercising opportunities for a margin of
    earnings due to price gains over costs of acquiring and holding a
    futures contract;\

-   *hedging*---guarding against adverse future price changes by locking
    in current prices; and\

-   *arbitrage*---simultaneous purchasing and selling identical, or
    nearly identical, commodities in two different markets in hope of
    gaining a profit from price differences.

#### History and Impact

Commodity futures markets are traced to the Middle Ages when they were
developed to meet the needs of farmers and merchants facing risks of
price variation of grains due to conditions of oversupply or shortage
brought on by weather, disaster, war, or politics (@carlton1984 provides
an extended history). Commodities exchanges came into existence as
formal institutions to act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers.
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were
established in the mid--19th century in the United States to make
markets for buyers and sellers of commodities. Many new commodity
exchanges came into existence subsequently. In 1972, the International
Monetary Market was established as a division of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange for futures trading of foreign currencies.

Futures markets are one of the most successful financial innovations for
trading commodity assets and financial instruments such as currencies,
bonds, or equity and debt options. Futures exchanges smooth the
communication between buyers and sellers and provide the conditions and
rules for trading, all of which is regulated in the United States by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

### How Information Markets Function Like Commodities Futures Markets

#### Common Structure

Information markets operate like commodity futures markets. The asset
traded in a commodity futures market is a physical good. As I described,
a buyer in commodity futures market might contract for delivery of 5,000
bushels of No. 2 Yellow Corn on next March 1 from a seller. By way of
contrast, markets that treat information as an asset to be traded and,
as a result, are described as *information markets*[^5] Information
markets for ideas in the form of propositions use the framework, tools,
and methods already available for handling commodity and financial
futures.

[^5]: Information markets are identified at times as "idea futures
    markets," "prediction markets," or "decision markets" because they
    are used to assemble forecasts and to align information for
    decision-making.

An information market is an exchange for trading specific propositions
describing the occurrence of an event by a subsequent point in time.
That is, ideas expressed as specific propositions are the objects
traded. An example of a proposition: "Sales of the XYZ Management
Adjustment Scale will generate \$2 million in revenue by the end of the
fourth quarter of 2025." The price of the shares indicate the likelihood
that the market participants believe that the proposition is true. The
volume of trades reveals the interest that the proposition generates
among traders. Price and volume are represent in a price-volume plot as
exemplified in Figure \@ref(fig:img-volpr) for the Fetterman *v* Oz
PredictIt market.

#### Price discovery

Information markets offer contracts priced between between zero and
\$1.00. The purchasing price shows the likelihood of the realization of
ideas. In particular, information trade on propositions about whether
events will occur and when. Just as in commodity and financial futures,
the price of a proposition:

-   *Reflects* the belief aggregated over traders that the proposition
    will be realized.\
-   *Is dynamic* because it is updated continuously based on market
    activity.\
-   *Is responsive* to public information as well as subtle perceptions,
    inside information, and specialized knowledge of information traders
    about factors thought to affect the eventual occurrence of an event
    by a future date. In this way, changes in the price of a proposition
    reflect changes in market participants beliefs based on information
    aggregated about the likelihood that the proposition will be
    realized.

The same sort of price discovery occurs in commodity and financial
futures markets

#### Implementation

Information markets and commodities and financial futures markets are
mounted on electronic exchanges that operate over the Internet to
multiply the reach and speed of market mechanisms to obtain timely
information. Information markets commonly use double-auction trading
mechanisms (i.e., many buyers, many sellers, one broker). Information
markets hold the potential to collect and report information in a
continuous stream of activity rather than through periodic or episodic
data collection and reporting that is common with survey methods. A
desirable feature is that information markets have the potential to
provide critical information per unit of time relatively less
expensively and simpler than survey methods.

Futures markets are highly regulated in the U.S. Because of the use of
actual cash for trading, markets run by PredictIt are under the
regulatory purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in
the U.S. The CFTC has issued a "no--action" letter to PredictIt stating
that as long as the PredictIt markets conform to certain guidelines, the
CFTC will take no action against PredictIt. The use of participants'
money is an important feature of PredictIt markets because, as the old
adage goes, no one spends your money better than you do. Due to the real
consequences of loss or gain, participants in PredictIt are stimulated
to seek information about the markets in which they participate. It is
this stimulation that sharpens the quality of the market price realized
for any proposition.

## Information Markets, Alive and Dead, That I have Known

To provide examples of the variety of information markets deployed, I
describe five information markets. Some of these markets still are
working; others are not. I summarize *The Foresight Exchange* (a wide
variety of scientific topics, political campaigns, and natural events),
the *Iowa Electronic Markets* (electoral events), the *Hollywood Stock
Exchange* (box office returns, opening weekend performance, Oscar
awards), and *TradeSports* (mainly sporting events). The most
controversial information market, by far, has been the *Policy Analysis
Market*.

### The Foresight Exchange

The Foresight Exchange [-@foresightexchange2022] is an example of an
information market. The Exchange bills itself as "the place to test your
ability to predict the outcome of future events. It is also the place to
check the current odds of upcoming events and make your own bets"
[@foresightexchange2022a]. One proposition in the Foresight Exchange,
with the ticker name **Bush04** [@foresightexchange2000a] (Figure
\@ref(fig:img-claim)).

```{r img-claim, echo=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Summary of the claim claim that Bush wins the 2000 U.S. presidential election.* <br> (Image from Foresight Exchange [-@foresightexchange2000].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/Claimnum.png")
```

The criterion for judging the claim is shown in (Figure
\@ref(fig:img-judge)).

```{r img-judge, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Rule for judging that claim that Bush won the 2000 U.S. presidential election.* <br> (Image from Foresight Exchange [-@foresightexchange2000].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/fore_claim.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:img-judge) is a plot of the price--volume plot for this
claim for one particular 100--day period prior to the United States
presidential election which displays the dynamics of changing beliefs
that this claim would be realized. Changes in beliefs in the continuing
presidency of George W. Bush are shown through changes in price over
time. Correlation of the price series with events surrounding the
presidential election campaign could provide insight into causal factors
underlying series' changes.

```{r img-bush, echo=FALSE,  out.width='90%', fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Price plot for the life of the claim that Bush will win the 2000 U.S. presidential election.* <br> (Y--axis is graduated in $0.01 increments. Image from Foresight Exchange [-@foresightexchange2000].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/infomarkets/bush2k.png")
```

Just to give a flavor of the diversity and specificity of topics on the
Foresight Exchange, several propositions active during 2022 include:

-   An earthquake of Richter magnitude ≥8, with epicenter within 100
    miles of (one of the US states) CA, OR, WA, AZ, NV, ID will occur
    before the end of 2025.\
-   By 2025 the Federal government of the United States will have ceased
    to function as a unified democracy.  
-   By the end of December 31, 2035, a humanly mobile robot will be in
    actual use, as a worker in some business use, consumer service,
    military use, civil service, or scientific capacity.  
-   Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life, fossils, or remains will be found

### Iowa Electronic Markets

The Iowa Electronic Markets [@universityofiowa2021] are small--scale,
on--line, real--money futures markets in which contract payoffs depend
on economic and political events such as elections, companies' earnings
per share, and stock price returns [@berg2003; @forsythe1992]. These
markets are operated by faculty at the University of Iowa Tippie College
of Business as part of their research and teaching mission. Participants
buy and sell by opening accounts for a minimum of \$5 and a maximum of
\$500. The markets operate continuously using a double--auction trading
mechanism.

The Iowa Electronic Markets allow participants to trade with actual
money, as opposed to fictional currency as in the Foresight Exchange.
Participants use their own funds to buy and sell contracts. Traders,
therefore, have the opportunity to profit from their trades, but must
also bear the risk of losing money. Because of the use of actual cash
for trading, the Iowa Electronic Markets are under the regulatory
purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States
of America, just as PredictIt is.

The use of participants' money is an important feature of the Iowa
Electronic Markets because, as the old adage goes, no one spends your
money better than you do. Due to the real consequences of loss or gain,
participants in the Iowa Electronic Markets are stimulated to seek
information about the markets in which they participate. It is this
stimulation that sharpens the quality of the market price realized for
any proposition.

The Iowa Electronic Markets are relatively accurate forecasts of
political election results provided compared with traditional political
polls. Although the comparison with polls might not be completely fair
[@berg2008], the Iowa Electronic Markets have shown no obvious biases
and, on average, considerable accuracy for large United States election
markets [@berg2003a]. Presidential election markets performed better
than lower profile congressional, state, and local election markets.
Markets with more volume near election time performed better than those
with less volume. And, markets with fewer contracts (i.e., fewer
candidates or parties), predicted election outcomes better than those
with more contracts. These attributes are desirable when the relative
high costs of political polls versus the relatively low costs of idea
futures markets are considered.

### Hollywood Stock Exchange

The Hollywood Stock Exchange is a now-defunct information market market
structured along the same lines as the Iowa Electronic Markets. The
Exchange allowed for trading on securities corresponding to movies (this
was called "MovieStocks"), including those in production and in
theaters, using fake money called "Hollywood Dollars." Each movie
security was liquidated four weeks after the release of the movie for
\$1 per \$1 million in box office gross.

Similar to "MovieStocks," a "StarBond" represented actors and directors
that were traded on the Hollywood Stock Exchange. The price of a
"StarBond" reflected overall star power of the actors and directors as
determined by Hollywood Stock Exchange traders, as well as how much
money celebrities' films made at the box office as determined by their
trailing average gross (TAG). If a celebrity should have happened to
meet the end of a career (death, retirement, etc.), the "StarBond" was
cashed out at the TAG.

The Hollywood Stock Exchange was a popular entertainment mechanism. The
structure of the Hollywood Stock Exchange was quite sophisticated, with
reserve and investment banks, leader boards, trading clubs, tickers,
insider trading, funds, options, warrants, and even its own "Hollywood
Securities and Exchange Commission." Based upon the volume of trades and
other activities, the Exchange demonstrated how active an information
market can become when it captures public interest.

### TradeSports

TradeSports was a web-based fantasy sports predictions game
[@heitner2014] that closed for business in 2015. To classify it plainly,
TradeSports was a gambling forum. It was run on--line from Ireland, so
it evaded anti--gambling laws in effect in many countries such as the
United States. What differentiated TradeSports from many other on--line
gambling outlets was the diverse betting topics that it covered and the
use of market mechanisms to operate its betting system.

TradeSports offered quite a diverse betting portfolio. Among the
prominent trades available were traditional sports bets (e.g., "Will
England win The Ashes 2005?"), contracts related to terrorism (e.g.,
"Will Osama Bin Laden be captured/neutralized by 31 December 2005?"),
and the likelihood of political outcomes (e.g., "Will John Bolton be
confirmed by the United States Senate to become the next United States
Ambassador to the UN?"). There were no handicappers setting the odds for
TradeSports bets. Rather, the price was driven entirely by market
transactions and self--organized under market principles. Also,
TradeSports demonstrated that, given sufficient motivation, many people
can be motivated to learn the intricacies of information market trading.

An interesting use of the TradeSports market was in a National Bureau of
Economic Research study [@leigh2003] that noticed a TradeSports market
for \"Saddam Securities\" moved closely with the
spot price of a barrel of crude oil. The \"Saddam Securities\" asset
paid off if
\"Saddam Hussein is not President/Leader of Iraq by [Date],\" with the
[Date]
substituted over various horizons by key contract dates of December
2002, March
2003, and June 2003. Using the specter of Hussein\'s continuation as
Iraq\'s
leader as a proxy for the likelihood of war and disruption in the Middle
East,
analysts were able to create a derivative security^3^ indicating that
war could raise oil prices by \$10 per barrel, lower the value of United
States\'
equities by 15%, and bolster gold and energy markets.

### Policy Analysis Market

One of the most controversial idea futures markets was the
quickly--aborted Policy Analysis Market [@wikipedia2022]that was
sponsored by the United States Department of Defense. The underlying
idea for the Policy Analysis Market was to build and test information
markets that would allow defense and intelligence analysts to speculate
such strategic and geopolitical issues as the probabilities of specific
kinds of failure within the national infrastructure of the United
States. Its goal was to develop market--based techniques for avoiding
surprise and predicting future events.

A now--archived Policy Analysis Market web site provided an example of a
complex derivative assembled from two idea futures contracts tied to the
now--historic case of pending hostilities between the United States and
Iraq: (a) whether the Jordanian monarchy would be overthrown during
hostilities between the United States and Iraq, and (b) the ability of
the Iraqi regime to persist for more than one month of hostilities. A
Policy Analysis Market trader who felt comfortable with both issues
might choose to trade a contract on a joint outcome, a type of market
derivative. Policy Analysis Market held the promise of applications of a
variety of similarly rich decision analysis tools associated with joint
probability analysis and combinatorial mathematics to anti--terrorism
analysis.

The Policy Analysis Market was cancelled by the United States Department
of Defense during late 2003 due to the controversial political substance
of the speculative propositions about that it would consider. The Policy
Analysis Market was criticized by United States politicians as more of a
"market for death", "a federal betting parlor on atrocities," and "an
incentive actually to commit acts of terrorism"
[@congressionalrecord2003a] rather than a decision tool. Abramovicz
[-@abramowicz2004] opined that the Policy Analysis Market "debacle has
provided a setback, maybe a permanent one, to anyone who might have
hoped to use information markets in administrative decision-making." The
controversy surrounding the Policy Analysis Market was front page news
in the United States. A member of the United States Senate, Byron
Dorgon, asked, "Can you imagine if another country set up a betting
parlor so that people could go in...and bet on the assassination of an
American political figure?" [@hulse2003].

Looney [-@looney2004] articulated several arguments offered by
counterintelligence agencies against the Policy Analysis Market. The
market created the incentive for someone to buy futures on a violent act
and then carry it out. Markets may be inefficient in the short run and
rumors might be used to manipulate the market. Hansen et al.
[-@hanson2005] noted that, although the Policy Analysis Market was
cancelled just one day after it was launched by the Department of
Defense, press reports following the cancellation indicated that press
reports about the Market became more positive as journalists began to
understand its motives and workings.

### Some Cautions and Technical Enhancements

Although information markets are capable of aggregating information
efficiently, they are susceptible to problems such as market
manipulation ([@hanson2006]; [@nöth2003]; ) and inability to settle on
an equilibrium price ([@anderson1997]; [@scharfstein1990]). These
problems are exacerbated when traders have limited experience with the
information being aggregated in the market and when markets are illiquid
(i.e., have few buyers and sellers) [@sunder1992].

Chen, Fine, and Huberman [-@chen2003] employed Bayesian estimators to
integrate prior information about risk aversion into estimates of
equilibrium prices in information markets with small numbers of
participants. Their process operates in two stages. First, an
information market is run to extract risk attitudes from market
participants, along with the participants' ability to predict a known
outcome. Constructed from this information about risk aversion is a
nonlinear aggregation function that allows for collective predictions of
uncertain events. Second, these same participants engage in a market for
an uncertain event. Individual market transactions are integrated using
the nonlinear function and are used to predict the outcome of the
uncertain event. Use of prior information substantially improved
estimates previously obtained solely through the idea futures market for
the event. In fact, estimates based on Bayesian nonlinear functions were
more accurate that the most accurate individual market traders.

## Conclusion

Information markets seem to be a useful alternative to survey methods for estimating candidate preferences of the electorate, as demonstrated in the information markets and survey-based approaches to following the Fetterman *v* Oz race. In spite of the long history of applications of information markets to information aggregation, pollsters for campaigns seem to prefer survey-based methods

## My Approach to the Topic of This Posting: Emphasis on Information Markets; Less Attention to Survey Methods {.appendix}

As I write this posting in August 2022, the U.S. is preparing for the
post-Labor Day start in earnest of campaigns for the November midterm
elections to public office. I often have wondered why political
candidates interested in public opinion levels and variations fail to
take advantage of information markets. Although I never have done the
calculations, my sense is that the relative cost of information markets
compared with conventional surveys per unit of information would favor
information markets. I guess you could count me as have a prior bias
toward information markets without further data, which is discernible by
the amount of emphasis I place in this blog on information markets. What
limits the adoption of information markets? I assess that the reluctance
to adopt information markets has to do with: (a) wide familiarity with
survey reporting from surveys and limited exposure to information
markets among clients and media; (b) difficulty in inducting
participants into information markets due to relatively small numbers of
people who do commodity futures trading (related to point (a)), and (c)
sparse software to support implementation of information markets.
