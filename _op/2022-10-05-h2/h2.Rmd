The transition towards a decarbonized and sustainable energy system is
expected to play a crucial role in halting the effects of global warming
while furthering human well-being, security, and sustainable development
[@internationalenergyagancy2021].

The term *energy transition* commonly refers to a pathway toward
transformation of the global energy sector from fossil-based to
zero-carbon by the second half of this century.

> Ten million metric tons of hydrogen are currently produced in the

> photoelectrochemical cells, and biological pathways. The primary uses
> of hydrogen in the United States today are in the oil refining and

> sector (e.g., metals refining), liquid fuels (e.g., biofuels,
> synfuels), heat generation, energy storage, and transportation.
