**The opinions in these NOTES are mine on the day I wrote them. Do I believe my own opinions now? Maybe. Did I believe them on the day I wrote them? Maybe. Sometimes I wrote these opinions to road test an argument or to follow a thread of thought. These opinions are not research papers, Information is cited lightly and sometimes one-sidedly. Look, I am just taking them out for a test ride. Write your own posting, respond to mine, or just walk on to Starbucks. **
