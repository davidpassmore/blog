Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, a Shell subsidiary located in Houston,
Texas [@dunbradstreet], decided in 2016 after a long planning period to
invest in building and operating an ethane cracker to support
polyethylene resin manufacturing in southwestern Pennsylvania (Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crackerM)). The 386-acre Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex is adjacent to the Ohio River in Potter and Center townships
near the borough of Monaca in Beaver County, Pennsylvania [@pennsylv,
"Project development"]. Polyethylene is a feedstock for manufacturing
plastic products, especially packaging and auto components. Polyethylene
is produced from ethylene created from steam processing of ethane, a
natural gas liquid found in some gas streams in the Marcellus and Utica
shale formations.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ethane_cracker.jpeg")
```

Shell has confirmed that the Complex will start operating in 2022
[@shrum2022]. @gist2016 wrote that "The Shell cracker represents one of
the biggest-ever industrial investments in the tristate region
(Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), whose industrial sector
suffered a series of set-backs through the second half of the 20^th^
century (para. 4)."

Why Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? "The basic answer is very
simple," said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At
the time, he was an executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia. Visser
said "You're sitting here on a world-class resource base at the doorstep
of your customer [@cocklin2016]."

Leaders of oil and gas industry associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia noted that "Our three states produce roughly one-third of
America's natural gas, making Appalachia the third largest gas producer
in the world -- behind only the U.S. itself and Russia" [@callahan2022].
More than 70% of North American polyethylene market exists within a
700-mile radius of the Complex [@pennsylvc, "Project development"].

Shell stuck with its decision to invest in the Complex, even though many
Shell projects worldwide were delayed, resized or canceled altogether
due to a downturn in the oil and gas markets as the Complex project
commenced [@davis2016].

### In This Blog Posting....

In the remainder of this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and gaps in
information that could influence the perceptions of the economic impact
of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.[^1] The flow of this blog
posting follows three threads:

[^1]: In another posting in NOTES from Pittsburgh [@passmore2022], I
    summarized the chemical engineering for cracking ethane feedstock to
    obtain ethylene and, from there, to produce polyethylene resin
    pellets, which have downstream uses to manufacture many consumer
    products.

-   I, first, delineate some of the questions that remain for me about
    the markets affecting the Complex, the worthiness of public
    expenditures on the Complex, and the expected regional economic
    effects of the Complex. I highlight the importance of evidence about
    expected economic impact to promote public acceptance of the Complex
    and to stimulate the need for public expenditures to support the
    Complex.\
-   Next, I outline my simple understanding of the steps in the
    operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Understanding
    these the nature and structure of inputs, processes, and outputs
    shapes expectations for the regional economic impact of the
    Complex.\
-   And, last, I critically examine a report by professors associated
    with Robert Morris University that was prepared for Shell Chemical
    Appalachia LLC [@clinton2021a]. This report was produced before the
    Complex was commissioned and was meant to provide evidence to
    satisfy questions about the expected impact of the Complex on the
    regional economy.

Read my manifesto, *My Point of View* in an appendix to this posting for
a brief statement of my motivations and approach to writing this blog
essay.

### Questions Remain About the Viability of the Complex

#### Can Product & Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?

Risk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels and
products derived from these fuels. In September 2020, @moodys2020 raised
questions about the credit-worthiness of new fossil fuel projects.
Markets, regulations, and concerns about the environment and quality of
human life are influencing the business proposition for added fossil
fuel capacity.

According to a biting 2020 opinion offered by @sanzillo2020 for the
[Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis](https://ieefa.org/),[^2] the Pennsylvania Petrochemical
Complex faces prospects of low product prices, price and supply
volatility in ethane feedstock markets, risk of oversupply of
polyethylene resins that the Complex will manufacture, stiff competition
from other producers, competition from the supply of recycled plastics
materials, and the influence of possible low general economic growth.
Concluded by the Institute was that the Complex "will open to market
conditions that are more challenging than when the project was planned.
The [C]omplex is likely to be less profitable than expected and face an
extended period of financial distress [@sanzillo2020, p.1; see, also,
@bruggers2020]."

[^2]: A non-profit whose work is aimed at supporting a sustainable
    energy economy.

```

#### Tax Expenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Are Large...But Prudent?

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allocated funds to support preparation
of the site for the Complex in Monaca. In addition, the Commonwealth
offered tax and financial incentives to site the Complex in
Pennsylvania. Use of the term, "incentives," however, makes the
Commonwealth's decision sound distant from its financial accounting.
Make no mistake, though. These incentives plainly are *tax
expenditures*, defined in an accounting sense by the U.S. Treasury
[@taxexpe; see, also, @hellerstein1966, p. 793] as

> revenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which
> allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income
> or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a
> deferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as
> alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or
> regulatory programs. (para. 1)

As a consequence of excluding taxes and offering tax credits for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, citizens of the Commonwealth forego
the opportunity to collect general fund revenue. Also, reduction of
revenue from these expenditures and credits could require the
Commonwealth to raise taxes to remain revenue-neutral [@sammartino2020,
p. 4]. In 2019, Stacker, a news organization, calculated that the tax
breaks allocated to the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex ranked 13th
in dollar value out of 50 national projects receiving corporate
subsidies from governments over a 20-year period [@crisafulli].

If projects were judged on costs alone, few investments would be made,
of course. Rather, citizens must weigh the costs of this public
investment in a private venture against the benefits distributed to the
regional economy that could accrue from the operation of the Complex. As
I will assert in more detail subsequently in this blog posting, I do not
believe that these benefits were demonstrated well before construction
and operation of the Complex.

##### Expenditures on Site Preparation

Funds from *Act 2 of 1995* [@landrec] -- which supports remediation of
tracts of land that were developed for industrial purposes, polluted,
and then abandoned (*aka* "brownfields") -- funded a portion of costs of
preparation of the site, the location of a former zinc smelter.
Remediation involved covering the site with clean fill, installing a
synthetic cap over previous disposal areas on the property, and
collecting and treating potentially contaminated storm water before
discharge [@shellpe]. Ate Visser said at a 2016 industry conference in
Pittsburgh that construction of the Complex would been impossible
without Act 2 funds [@cocklin2016b, ¶7]. At the time, Visser was an
executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia.

Commonwealth expenditures did not alone fund site preparation. Shell
incurred significant expenses. For example, Shell committed \$80 million
on top of Act 2 funds to clean up environmental contamination at the
site and prepare the land for construction of the Complex
[@cocklin2016b, ¶6]. A PennDOT spokesman, said Shell paid for a \$60
million project to alter a Commonwealth roadway, Pennsylvania Route 18,
and make other road fixes at the site [@bumsted2016]. Also, Shell paid
nearly \$70 million to move Center Township's water intake site and
build Township a new water treatment plant. The water intake was located
where Shell built docking facilities for delivery of equipment during
the construction phase of the Complex (@cocklin2016c, para. 4).

##### Tax Expenditures Offered as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offered major incentives for siting the
Complex in Pennsylvania:

-   *Act 16 in 2012* [@keystone] makes Shell exempt from all corporate
    net income taxes and property taxes for 25 years after first
    occupying the Beaver County site, as long as it invests at least one
    billion dollars (not necessarily in Pennsylvania) and creates at
    least 400 new permanent full-time jobs. Shell said it would deploy
    600 jobs to operate the Complex [@pennsylv, "Environment and
    society"].\
-   *Act 85 in 2012* [@taxrefo] gives Shell a tax credit of 5 cents for
    every gallon of ethane it buys to manufacture ethylene, provided
    that 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs are created during construction
    of the Complex (≅6,000 were, according to Shell [@shellst]). Shell
    will pay no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but Shell can benefit by
    selling unused credits as tax equity for other purchasing firms to
    reduce their own tax liability.

```{r img-acts, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Pennsylvania Act 16 and Act 85 <br> (Images captured  from www.legis.state.pa.us website and edited by David Passmore)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/actsofcorbett.jpg")
```

Thomas Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought an
annual \$66 million tax credit for 25 years, a total of \$1.65 billion.
If the Complex sustains between 400 to 600 jobs annually for 25 years, a
rough, undiscounted calculation[^3] indicates a cost per job over the
25-year period between \$2.75 million and \$.13 million, which equals
\$165,000 to \$112,000 per job per year. The dollar figure was not
placed in the final draft of legislation, meaning that the credits are
unlimited and flexible [@bumsted2012]. Shell's Visser said "I can tell
you, with hand to my heart, that without these incentives, we would not
have made this investment decision [@cocklin2016a, ¶6]." Thomas Corbett,
Pennsylvania Governor who steered these expenditures through
legislation, said that "When you're looking at the investment you have
to look at what it would have cost us had we done nothing, had we let
these businesses go" [@detrow2012].

[^3]: And, my own calculation. So quite unofficial.

The extant research literature examining the relationship between
offering tax incentives and consequent economic growth is complex,
varied, and inconclusive [@buss2001a, pp. 94-100]. In particular,
evidence is weak that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader
economic growth at the state and local levels [@slattery2020].
@bartik2020 reported that so-called "place-based" policies cost around
\$60 billion annually (in 2019 dollars) and that the typical state and
local incentive offer, as a percent of the value-added of the business
receiving an incentive, tripled in size between in the 30 years
preceding 2019.

The body of research is thin about the economic growth resulting from
using state and local expenditures of tax revenue to subsidize private
firms, State governments prefer not to conduct rigorous evaluations the
costs and benefits of tax expenditures to incentivize site location
decisions [@buss2001]. An open question is whether firms would decide to
relocate to a region without incentives, especially if the region offers
unique and desirable business opportunities. As far as I know, the
Commonwealth has not embarked on an assessment of Act 16 and Act 85
expenditures. The net benefit of tax expenditures on the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex remains to be demonstrated.

#### Is the Complex Expected to Change the Regional Economy?

##### Shell's Stake, Different Than the Public's

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sums to a massive long-term
investment in money, time, effort, and planning by Shell. Shell
undoubtedly foresees a financial return from investing in the Complex,
even though the Complex will face the vagaries of resource and product
markets and emerging regulation, as will any forward-looking decision in
the energy sector. Shell makes decisions as a private enterprise sharing
ownership with stockholders. As such Shell properly must invoke the
criterion of "what's in it for us and, ultimately, our shareholders" in
its decisions.

Deep inside the company's spreadsheets, Shell must have weighed on a
finely-tuned scale the current and future costs, risks, uncertainties,
revenue, and profits in the balance of its worldwide business efforts to
yield the momentous decision to move forward with the Complex.
Proceeding to build and operate the Complex was a complex, bold, and
courageous business decision made by one of the largest independent
energy firms in the world. Much is at stake for Shell.

Shell's success also could translate to a positive impact on the
regional economy in proportion that the inputs purchased for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex originate in the region and its
outputs are sold and used subsequently for manufacturing in the region.
Such an impact on the regional economy is, however, incidental and is
not essential for Shell's success. Commonwealth tax expenditures reduce
Shell's costs in exchange for modest job and investment guarantees for
construction and operation of the Complex.

##### The Public's Interest, Different Than Shell's

Through the Commonwealth's expenditures of tax revenues, Pennsylvania
citizens have become significant financial stakeholders in the Complex.
Yet, measures of success expected from the Complex by Pennsylvania
citizens are not the same as Shell's. Citizens seek regional economic
impact from their investments in the form of jobs and income for
citizens and tax revenue for governments to fund public goods and
services. Commonwealth and local tax collection from Shell were foregone
by state legislation, however.

These expenditures of tax revenues for Shell and other energy companies
came at the same time as reduced spending for county-level public health
programs and other public services and an across-the-board \$1 billion
cut in state spending [@detrow2012a, para. 2]**.** In addition,
negotiations about these expenditures remained hidden from public view
due to confidentiality agreements with Shell [@phillips2012]. Thomas
Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time,

> "Pushed back against the argument the tax break is a corporate
> giveaway, saying, 'They think we're giving money to them. No we're
> not. What we're saying is, you build it. You provide all these jobs
> for all these people. And we'll take a little less money for you, so
> we have more money for us.' " [@detrow2012e]

Any enterprise engaging in business transactions -- even an enterprise
so primitive as a child's lemonade stand -- generates an economic
impact. So, there is no doubt that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex will have some impact on the regional economy. But, how much?
When? Will the benefits of regional economic impact cover the costs of
expenditures of revenue collected from Pennsylvania citizens? Answers to
these critical questions about the public benefits of the Complex would
justify expenditures on the Complex by Pennsylvania citizens.

##### Evidence Asserting Potential Regional Impact That Was Considered in Planning Stages

Without a doubt, several reports from the American Chemistry Council, a
trade association,[^4] framed the potential benefits of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex for Pennsylvania citizens, their elected
legislators, and public officials. In 2011, the Council reported
[@americanchemistrycouncil2011, p. 1] that a "25 percent increase in
ethane supply on growth in the petrochemical sector....would generate: 

[^4]: The American Chemistry Council defines itself as "America's oldest
    trade association of its kind, representing more than 190 companies
    engaged in the business of chemistry -- an innovative, economic
    growth engine that is helping to solve the biggest challenges facing
    our country and the world. Our members are the leading companies
    engaged in all aspects of the business of chemistry, from the
    largest corporations to the smallest, and everything in between"
    [@aboutac].

-   17,000 new knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs in the U.S.
    chemical industry 

-   395,000 additional jobs outside the chemical industry (165,000 jobs
    in other industries that are related to the increase in U.S.
    chemical production and 230,000 jobs from new capital investment by
    the chemical industry) 

-   \$4.4 billion more in federal, state, and local tax revenue,
    annually (\$43.9 billion over 10 years) 

-   A \$32.8 billion increase in U.S. chemical production 

-   \$16.2 billion in capital investment by the chemical industry to
    build new petrochemical and derivatives capacity 

-   \$132.4 billion in U.S. economic output (\$83.4 billion related to
    increased chemical production (including additional supplier and
    induced impacts) plus \$49.0 billion related to capital investment
    by the U.S. chemical industry)"

In 2012, the American Chemistry Council issued an addendum to their
national report that focused on the economic impact of natural gas
development in Pennsylvania. The Council asserted that an

> "additional \$4.8 billion in chemical industry activity would generate
> over 2,400 high-paying, desirable jobs in the Pennsylvania chemical

In addition,

complex

The Council also asserted that construction of a petrochemical facility,
purchase of new equipment for the facility, and operation of the
facility would result in federal and state tax revenues of \$363 million
and local tax revenues of \$141 million [@americanchemistrycouncil2012c,
Table 3 and Table 4].

These reports were released at the front edge of the natural gas
revolution, the "pivot of world's energy future" [@kolb2014]. Thomas
Corbett, the Governor of Pennsylvania, said that he trusted the
Council's estimates of potential economic impact [@detrow2012d]. The
Commonwealth did not conduct its own independent study of the potential
economic impact of ethane cracking and plastic resin production in
Pennsylvania [@detrow2012b] -- nor did it finish its own study in time
to affect legislation of tax expenditures [@detrow2012c, para. 10].

The American Chemical Society's reports about the potential economic
impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex were the linchpins in
the appeal that secured allocation of tax expenditures through Act 16
and Act 85 to support the construction and operation of the Complex.
However, questions still remain about the validity of the American
Chemical Society estimates of the potential economic impact of the
Complex and, therefore, whether the reports demonstrated the potential
benefits from Pennsylvania citizens' investment in the Complex.

A more recent report, *Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical
Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021], written by
professors associated with Robert Morris University for Shell Chemical
Appalachia LLC was released in 2021. This report was meant to provide
evidence to satisfy questions about the expected impact of the Complex
on the regional economy before the Complex is commissioned in 2022.

I believe that the report from Robert Morris University researchers did
not reduce uncertainty that remained about the wisdom of tax
expenditures on the Complex. In fact, I assert that conceptual and
methodological flaws in the American Chemistry Council and Robert Morris
reports rendered their conclusions suspect and, therefore, negated their
usefulness for justifying public expenditures to support the
construction and operation of the Complex. I do *not* deny that regional
economic benefits will flow from the Complex, just that the reports are
inadequate to uphold decisions made to allocate public expenditure for
the Complex.

I defer to the last major section of this blog posting my criticisms of
the recent report from Robert Morris University, criticisms that I
believe apply similarly for the almost decade-old American Chemical
Society reports. Necessarily prior, though, to motivate my criticisms is
a common understanding the inputs, processes, and outputs form the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. So,next, I offer my bare bones
description of the operation of the Complex and refer to information in
this description in my subsequent review the Robert Morris report.

### Operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven
ethane cracker units, one high density polyethylene and two low density
polyethylene resin manufacturing units, a natural gas-fired combustion
turbine, four emergency diesel generators, multiple fuel and storage
tanks, multiple flaring units and an incinerator
[@stateofpennsylvania2016, pp. 5-7]. Displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-processF) are inputs, processes, and products of the
Complex. For simplicity of presentation, the flow of activity portrayed
in Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) skims over many of the details of the
ethane-to-ethylene-to-plastic resin process. I narrate some of the
details about inputs, processes, and outputs that are behind Figure
\@ref(fig:img-processF).

```{r img-processF, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Processes in the Operation of Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. <br> (Graphic drawn by David Passmore using DiagrammeR package in RStudio)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ProcessFlow.png")
```

#### Inputs

The Complex is anticipated to produce 3.9 million barrels of ethane
annually by cracking ethane molecules to make ethylene [@sanzillo2020,
p. 7].[^5] All of the ethane required by the Complex is delivered to the
Complex by the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System, a 97-mile pipeline network
from Houston, Pennsylvania, and Cadiz and Scio in Ohio. (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-falcon)). As with many aspects of the construction and
operation of the Complex, the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System has
generated considerable controversy [see, e.g., @realtal2022].

[^5]: I caution that the magnitude of numbers representing the supply of
    inputs to the Complex and its outputs were offered by Shell before
    initiation of the project and will depend on market conditions that
    drive Complex activity.

```{r img-falcon, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Falcon Ethane Pipeline. <br> (Map from https://bit.ly/FalconPipeline)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/Falcon-Ethane-Pipeline.png")
```

At these three nodes in the pipeline network are gas processing plants
that separate liquids and remove solids or other particulate matter in
the gas stream lifted from regional wells drawing from Marcellus and
Utica shale formations. The three modes are tactically located proximal
to clusters of wells producing "wet" gas. Some wells not only produce
natural gas as methane, but also include natural gas liquids such as
ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane. These products constitute as
liquids when, depending on the gas pressure, they condense to become the
"wet," portion of the natural gas [@hey2017]. In general, Marcellus and
Utica shale formations in Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, and West
Virginia involve wet gas (See Figure \@ref(fig:img-wet) for locations).

```{r img-wet, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2, out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Locations of Wet and Dry Gas in Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations. <br> (Map from https://bit.ly/wet-dry-gas)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/wetdry.jpg")
```

Natural gas fires a 250-megawatt turbine that produces steam for the
ethane cracker and generates electricity for the Complex. The local
electrical grid could buy one-third of the electricity output of the
power plant [@newshel].

Superheated pressurized steam in the cracker vaporizes ethane. Heat
splits the bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms in ethane to yield
ethylene (more detail in @passmore2022a, para, 5). *Oil & Gas Journal*
[@brelsford2021] reported that the Complex also will draw 20 million
gallons of water every day from the Ohio River. Some water not used to
generate steam is used to cool the effluent produced by the cracker.
Water is reused or returned to the river as a by-product[^6] after
treatment to meet water quality standards.

[^6]: A by-products is a material produced as a residual of, or
    incidental to, the production process. In an accounting sense,
    by-products are associated with costs.

#### Processes

At the core of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex are ethane
crackers that supply ethylene for making polymer resin extruded as
pellets.

##### Cracking

An ethane cracker is a furnace into which ethane is fed. The ethane is
diluted with with steam that is heated to 1300° F. The heat of the
furnace cracks ethylene from ethane molecules, freeing two molecules of
hydrogen in the process and creating a double bond between carbon atoms.
[^7] The hot gas mixture exhausted from the cracker is cooled, or
"quenched [@quenchw]," with water to prevent further chemical reactions.
Water is recovered for recycling back into the cracking process,
although some is treated and discharged as a by-product of the Complex
[@partlow2022].

[^7]: A a type of chemical bond in which two electron pairs are shared
    between two atoms [@helmenstinea].

```{r img-crack, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external", out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Comparison of the Chemical Structures of Ethane and Ethylene. <br> (Image from https://insights.globalspec.com/images/assets/490/1490/LNG-04a.jpg)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/LNG-04a.jpeg")
```

Ethylene and other substances exhausting in a gaseous state from the
cracker is compressed to a liquid state and, then, refrigerated.
Fractional distillation further separates ethylene from the cooled,
quenched mixture by taking advantage of differences in the vaporization
point of ethylene compared with other chemical components of the mixture
[@helmenstine].

Various gases that are by-products of cracking are burned off into the
air in a controlled combustion process called "flaring" [@flaring],
which releases carbon dioxide into the air as a by-product. Wastewater
from the cracker is collected, treated, and discharged. Then, the
ethylene produced is stored for use in manufacturing of plastic resins.

An important observation is that ethylene cracked from ethane is not
reported to be a product of the Complex that is meant to be sold to
customers. Instead, all ethylene produced seems to be consumed as an
input to polyethylene manufacturing, the next and final stage of
production in the Complex. Ethane cracking gathers more attention than
polymerization probably because the ethane cracker forms a large
footprint at the Complex and consumes most inputs of ethane, water,
electricity, and steam to the Complex. The final product of the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sold to customers is, in fact,
pelletized polyethylene resin. *This fact has important consequences for
the validity of estimates that have been made of economic impact of the
Complex.* More to that point subsequently in this blog posting.

##### Polymerization

Unique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single
chemical bonds with up to four other atoms and to double or triple bond
with itself, as in a double-bond ethylene molecule (again, see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). Carbon is one of the only elements, because of
its bonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped molecules to
form the basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
and proteins that serve as the basis of life itself. Chaining together
ethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical process called
*polymerization* produces polyethylene (a polymer, which means "many
parts").

Polyethylene production is initiated by a catalyst suspended with
ethylene molecules under pressure.[^8] In a catalyst bonds ethylene
monomers into a long chain forming a polymer (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-polymer)). The polymerization process releases high
amounts of heat.[^9] As a consequence, continuous cooling is required to
prevent runaway chemical reactions [@burdett2018, p. 67]. After
inclusion of additives and further conditioning, the polymer is extruded
to form pellets, the primary product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex.

[^8]: A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions, but is
    not consumed during the reaction. Most industrial chemical processes
    involve catalysts of various kinds.

[^9]: More technically, an *exothermic reaction*.

#### Outputs

Plastic resin in pellet form is the product of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex that has market value for Shell. At the same
time, the Complex accumulates by-products of its industrial processes
have consequence for the public health and environmental quality.

##### Polyethylene Resin Pellets

Polyethylene has many desirable attributes for manufacturing. According
to @kaiser2021, polyethylene can handle large loads without fracture. It
is flexible and can be stretched. Polyethylene has a relatively low
melting point compared with other plastics and absorbs no water.
Polyethylene is a good electrical insulator and can be produced to be
transparent. Polyethylene has thermoplastic properties useful in
production -- i.e., it softens or fuses when heated and hardens and
becomes rigid again when cooled. The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
will produce high density and low density polyethylene (see,
respectively, @whatis and @lowdens).

Nearly all polyethylene typically is sold as small (≅5mm), white,
lentil-shaped pellets, although round, flat, square, cylindrical, and
various other shapes of many colors are manufactured (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-nurd)). The pellets are known as "nurdles." Nurdles are
bagged and stored before distribution by rail, water transport, or truck
to warehouses or directly to customers. The added cost of pelletizing
polyethylene is considerable [@burdett2018b, p. 67], but nurdles are
relatively easy to ship.

```

These plastic pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in
downstream markets. Pellet prices are volatile [@pederson2021] because
they are driven on the supply side by equally volatile prices for
natural gas and on the demand side by two major factors. First,
consumers express preferences for "eco-friendly" packaging solutions.
Second, environmental regulation of plastic products is increasing. Some
observers believe nurdles are one of the most destructive toxic wastes
released in the environment (see discussion by @mcveigh).

##### By-Products

Many industrial processes create co-products and by-products.
Co-products are goods or services produced incidental to main production
that have market value to generate revenue. A by-product typically is a
material that is a consequence of production that is associated with
costs. I could not find evidence to indicate that the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex will generate co-products. However, the Complex
will create by-products, the cost of which Shell will bear, in part, by
paying for permits to discharge substances into the environment. Other
costs of by-products might be borne separately by Pennsylvania citizens
or jointly with Shell.

Cracking ethane emits by-products that can render the air, soil, water,
or other natural resources unsuitable for use or harmful. Small
inhalable particles emitted can damage short- and long-term human
respiratory function. Volatile organic compounds associated with
respiratory ailments emanate from cracking. Cracking also releases
carbon dioxide, a gas that can absorb energy within the infrared
wavelengths. This energy is transferred by collision with other
molecules. Faster molecular motion produces heat. Trapped heat from this
action of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is the "greenhouse
effect" that has influenced the long-term warming of the planet's
overall temperature. The @environmentallawinstitute delineated many of
the by-products of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex that could
pose threats to human health and environmental safety.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection required for
this first-of-its-kind facility in Pennsylvania complex environmental
reviews, approvals, and permits for new construction, remediation of
contamination from previous industrial activities on the property, and
operation. The Department keeps a running list of news on its website
(see @pennsylvb ) about the Complex, permits and approvals obtained for
the construction and operation of the facility, and
compliance/enforcement actions taken by government agencies to regulate
the Complex.

### Questions Remain About the Potential Impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex on the Regional Economy

Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC made a complex, courageous, and
consequential decision to build and operate the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex. Shell says that the Complex will open sometime
in 2022. The Commonwealth's citizens also invest with Shell in the
Complex. Foregoing current and future tax expenditures by the
Commonwealth reduced Shell's start-up costs, will subsidize purchases of
ethane for cracking and eliminates much of Shell's state and local tax
liability.

Although Shell and the Commonwealth invest jointly in the Complex, their
investment goals differ. Shell aims to sell plastic pellets from the
Complex for a profit. The Commonwealth wishes to benefit from the impact
the Complex could have on regional jobs, income, business activity, and
tax revenue.

Shell will review its balance sheets and earnings reports to judge its
yield from the Complex. The Commonwealth certainly can review regional
economic data to account for the impact of the Complex, although I am
not aware of any impact assessment plan once the Complex starts
operations. Shell-sponsored forecasts of the potential economic impact
of the Complex seem to have provided the rationale for the
Commonwealth's decision to invest in the Complex. *Potential* ≠
*realized outcome*.

I believe that reports about the forecasts made public by Shell might
have included conceptual orientations and methodological approaches that
left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of potential
economic impact. Therefore, some assessment is appropriate of the value
of Shell's forecasts to justify Pennsylvania Citizens trust in
investment in the Complex.

In this major section of this blog posting, I critically review a recent
report about the potential regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex. This report, *Updated Economic Impact Analysis:
Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021],
was prepared for Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC. The apparent aim of the
report was to satisfy public questions about economic value of the
Complex for the regional economy.

When the Robert Morris report[^10] was released in 2021, the report's
authors were identified as faculty members in the School of Business at
[Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/academics/schools/sbus).
Earlier similarly produced economic impact reports by the American
Chemistry Council appeared while the Pennsylvania legislature was
considering incentives through tax expenditures to aid construction and
operation of the Complex. I believe that these Council reports share
nearly the same methodology and analytics, as well as some of the same
issues, evident in the Robert Morris report by @clinton2021. Dissection
of the Robert Morris report ca shed light on validity of the American
Chemistry Council reports, also.

[^10]: I will refer in the remainder of this blog posting to the report,
    *Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver
    County, Pennsylvania,* as the "Robert Morris report." In making this
    assignment, I realize that I might promote the error of conflating
    the personal work of a team of professors with the official position
    of Robert Morris University. In 1940, the American Association of
    University Professors (AAUP), affirmed the "free search for truth
    and its free exposition" [@1940sta2006, para. 1] of faculty
    researchers. Faculty research findings are not necessarily
    university conclusions. As this independence of expression is
    executed, the AAUP enjoined faculty researchers that they "should be
    accurate at all times" [@1940sta2006, item 3 in "Academic Freedom"].
    I am not suggesting that the authors of the Robert Morris report hid
    behind an often-assumed cloak of endorsement from Robert Morris
    University itself or that their work was not accurate. Rather, my
    point is to separate Robert Morris University as a locus for this
    research from the methods chosen by the researchers and the findings
    they reached. The blending of the aims and conclusions of
    researchers with their employing institutions is common in
    discussion of the potential economic impact of Pennsylvania natural
    gas development and production. Rose Baker and I discussed problems
    created by referring to forecasts funded by the Marcellus Shale
    Coalition of the economic impact of Pennsylvania natural gas
    development and production as the "Penn State studies"
    [@passmore2011].

```

I structure my critical review of the Robert Morris report along three
lines:

-   *Summary.* First, I summarize the Robert Morris report. This report
    relies on input-output modeling, a data-based, computational, and
    often prospective approach to unwinding the impact of projects,
    events, and changes in local economies. An input-output model
    accounts for goods and services that are required as inputs by
    industries to produce outputs of goods and services necessary to
    satisfy supply requirements for inputs to other industries and
    delivery directly to consumers [@miernyk1965]. The Robert Morris
    report applied IMPLAN software [@economic2019] to compute impact
    estimates. IMPLAN has been described as the "gold standard" for
    economic impact analysis. Throughout my analysis of the Robert
    Morris report, I will refer to an essay I authored @passmore2022b
    that describes the technical details of input-output modeling.\
-   *Issues.* Next, I identify four issues in the Robert Morris report
    that left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of the
    potential economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
    Complex:\
    -   *Specification of the Geography for Impact.* The Robert Morris
        Report focuses on impact in Beaver County as well as in a
        multi-county area near the Complex. I examine information about
        travel to and from work in Beaver County that suggests it is
        worthy of considering following data the Complex will distribute
        economic impact over different geography.\
    -   *Classification of the Industry Creating Impact.* The Complex is
        classified in the "Petroleum Refineries" industry in the Robert
        Morris report. I argue that, because the primary product of the
        Complex is polyethylene pellets, output from the Complex
        probably is best classified within the "Plastic Resins"
        industry. Differences in the classification of the industry
        creating impact are important because drawing on data from a
        different industries likely would yield different impact
        estimates.\
    -   *Identification of the Indirect Impact.* Plastic resin
        production will directly support jobs at the Complex that pay
        wages to workers and extract wage taxes for governments. Also,
        the Complex will purchase goods and services from suppliers,
        who, in turn, will indirectly create additional business value,
        income, jobs, and taxes. In addition, pay received by workers in
        the Complex and by workers in the firms that supply the Complex
        will induce purchasing of consumer goods and services. Because
        the amount and kind of Shell's anticipated purchases of goods
        and services are not known, the indirect economic impact of the
        Complex is not clear. As a result, potential exists to over- or
        under-statement of the full economic impact of the Pennsylvania
        Petrochemicals Complex. Also, if the primary product of the
        Complex is, as I assert, best classified as plastic resin, not
        ethylene, then misspecification of the full economic impact of
        the Complex shown the Robert Morris report is possible.\
    -   *Appropriateness of a Forty-Year Forecast of Impact.* Projected
        in the Robert Morris report is the expected 40-year economic
        impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.[^11] IMPLAN,
        the developer of software applied to produce the Robert Morris
        report, cautions against long-term forecasting due to various
        limitations of the static input-output model programmed by
        IMPLAN in representing the dynamics operating over time in the
        actual economy [@datateam2022, "Why Isn't There Any
        Forecasting"]. The 40-year estimates of impact displayed in the
        Robert Morris report were prominent in public discussion of the
        Complex in the popular and environmental press. I believe that
        these 40-year estimates of impact constitute an extension of
        modeling and data beyond their limitations.\
-   *Next Steps.* Last, I describe briefly ways that remain for
    documenting any regional economic impact of the Complex. These ways
    do not include replicating the Robert Morris report after the
    Complex starts operations. The ship already has sailed for Shell.
    Barring any major impediment, the Complex will open. And, for right
    or for wrong, the Commonwealth has codified its commitment to
    investment in the Complex through legislation. Time to look forward
    to try to attribute emerging activity by the Complex to actual
    regional economic changes. This attempt would draw necessarily on
    innovations in the creative and complex design of natural
    experiments structured around regional economic data before and
    after the start-up of the Complex and a comparison with comparable
    economic regions without an ethane cracker. As far as I know, the
    Commonwealth does not plan to perform such an assessment.

[^11]: A 40-year span of life of the Complex might seem like a rather
    long period of plant service for which to estimate economic impact.
    @pearson2010 concluded that the average life of ethylene plants in
    North America and Europe will be around 30 years considering the
    anticipated effects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion,
    carburization-oxidation, and possible critical plant failure,
    although innovations could extend petrochemical and chemical plants
    well beyond their original anticipated design life. The real
    question seems whether sustaining the Complex's product and resource
    markets is possible for as long as the infrastructure for the
    Complex is viable.

## My Point of View {.appendix}

I do not mean this blog posting to advocate, *pro* or *con*, the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, although my narrative in this
posting often carries a critical and evaluative tone. Rather, I wrote
this blog posting to document and clarify the meanings I attached to the
political and economic history, status, and future of the Complex. The
process of writing this blog posting was essential to me because as E.
M. Forster, English fiction writer, essayist and librettist, reputedly
once wrote, "How do I know what I think until I see what I say?"

Now, I certainly tried to keep you in mind, dear reader, as I composed
this blog posting. My primary motivation behind this posting, however,
was selfishly on my own learning. I suppose if this blog posting had
been written with readers as my primary audience, it would have been
tighter, contained fewer asides, and eschewed deep and turgid
cul-de-sacs of vocabulary and argument. But, I wrote it for me.
Therefore, I did not feel constrained to reduce my word count, to "get
to the point" quicker, or to genuflect toward *de rigeur* authors and
the arguments pushed at us with bullying *absolutum dominium* as I might
if I had been forced to write for an academic journal while in a state
of dread anticipating the pontificating, pointy, and poisonous attacks
from a demonic "reviewer #2" [@guillet2020].

So, there you have it. As Bill Belichick, New England Patriots head
coach and general manager, often tells reporters, "It is what it is." My
ride. I just picked you up as a hitcher.
