Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, a Shell subsidiary located in Houston,
Texas [@dunbradstreet], decided in 2016 after a long planning period to
invest in building and operating an ethane cracker to support a
polyethylene resin manufacturing facility at a 400-acre Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex adjacent to the Ohio River in Potter and Center
townships in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. [@pennsylv, "Project
development"] (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-crackerM)). Polyethylene is a
feedstock for manufacturing plastic products, especially plastic
packaging and auto components. The polyethylene is produced from
ethylene created from steam processing of ethane, a natural gas liquid
lifted along with natural gas (methane) from so-called "wet gas" in
Marcellus and Utica shale formations.

```

Shell is reported to confirm that the Complex will start operating in
2022 [@shrum2022]. @gist2016 wrote that "The Shell cracker represents
one of the biggest-ever industrial investments in the tristate region
(Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), whose industrial sector
suffered a series of set-backs through the second half of the 20^th^
century (para. 4)."

Why Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? "The basic answer is very
simple," said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At
the time, he was an executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia. Visser
said "You're sitting here on a world-class resource base at the doorstep
of your customer [@cocklin2016]." Shell stuck with its decision to
invest in the Complex, even though many Shell projects worldwide were
delayed, resized or canceled altogether due to a downturn in the oil and
gas markets as the Complex project began [@davis2016].

Leaders of oil and gas industry associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia noted that "Our three states produce roughly one-third of
America's natural gas, making Appalachia the third largest gas producer
in the world -- behind only the U.S. itself and Russia" [@callahan2022].
More than 70% of North American polyethylene market exists within a
700-mile radius of the Complex [@pennsylvc, "Project development"].

In the remainder of this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and
information gaps that could influence the Shell's successful operation
of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex as well as the the Complex's
benefits to the regional economy.[^1] The flow of this blog posting:

[^1]: In another posting in NOTES from Pittsburgh [@passmore2022], I
    summarized the chemical engineering for cracking ethane feedstock to
    obtain ethylene and, from there, to produce polyethylene resin
    pellets, which have downstream uses in the manufacture of many
    consumer products.

-   I, first, delineate some of the questions that remain for me about
    the markets affecting the Complex, the worthiness of public
    expenditures on the Complex, and the expected regional economic
    effects of the Complex. I highlight the importance of evidence about
    expected economic impact to promote public acceptance of the Complex
    and to stimulate the need for public expenditures to support the
    Complex.\
-   Next, I outline my understanding of the steps in the operation of
    the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Understanding these the
    nature and structure of inputs, processes, and outputs shape
    expectations for the regional economic impact of the Complex.\
-   And, last, I critically examine a report by professors at Robert
    Morris University supported by Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC that
    was meant to provide evidence to satisfy questions about the
    expected impact of the Complex on the regional economy before the
    Complex was commissioned.

### Questions Remain About the Viability of the Complex

#### Can Product & Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?

Risk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels and
products from these fuels. In September 2020, @moodys2020 raised
questions about the credit-worthiness of new fossil fuel projects.
Markets, regulations, and concerns about the environment and quality of
life are influencing the business proposition for added fossil fuel
capacity.

According to a biting 2020 opinion offered by @sanzillo2020 for the
[Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis](https://ieefa.org/), the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex
faces prospects of low product prices, price and supply volatility in
ethane feedstock markets, risk of oversupply of polyethylene resins that
the Complex will manufacture, stiff competition from other producers,
competition from recycled plastics materials, and the influence of
possible low overall economic growth. Concluded by the Institute was
that the Complex "will open to market conditions that are more
challenging than when the project was planned. The [C]omplex is likely
to be less profitable than expected and face an extended period of
financial distress [@sanzillo2020, p.1]."

#### Tax Expenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Are Large...But Prudent?

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allocated funds to support preparation
of the site for the Complex in Monaca. In addition, the Commonwealth
offered tax and financial incentives to site the Complex in
Pennsylvania. Use of the term, "incentives," however, makes the
Commonwealth's decision sound distant from its financial accounting.
Make no mistake, though. These incentives plainly are *tax
expenditures*, defined in an accounting sense by the U.S. Treasury
[@taxexpe] as

> revenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which
> allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income
> or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a
> deferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as
> alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or
> regulatory programs. (para. 1)

As a consequence of excluding taxes and offering tax credits for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, citizens of the Commonwealth forego
the opportunity to collect general fund revenue. Also, reduction of
revenue from these expenditures and credits could require the
Commonwealth to raise taxes to remain revenue-neutral [@sammartino2020,
p. 4]. In 2019, Stacker, a news organization, calculated that the tax
breaks allocated to the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex ranked 13th
in dollar value out of 50 national projects receiving corporate
subsidies from governments over a 20-year period [@crisafulli].

If projects were judged on costs alone, few investments would be made,
of course. Rather, citizens must weigh the costs of this public
investment in a private venture against the benefits distributed to the
regional economy that could accrue from the operation of the Complex. As
I will assert in more detail subsequently in this blog posting, I do not
believe that these benefits were demonstrated well before construction
and operation of the Complex.

##### Site Preparation

Funds from *Act 2 of 1995* [@landrec], which supports remediation of
tracts of land that were developed for industrial purposes, polluted,
and then abandoned (*aka* "brownfields"), were applied to help fund
preparation of the site, the location of a former zinc smelter.
Remediation involved covering the site with clean fill, installing a
synthetic cap over previous disposal areas on the property, and
collecting and treating potentially contaminated storm water before
discharge [@shellpe]. Ate Visser said at a 2016 industry conference in
Pittsburgh that construction of the Complex would been impossible
without Act 2 funds [@cocklin2016b, ¶7]. At the time, Visser was an
executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia.

Commonwealth expenditures did not alone fund site preparation. Shell
incurred significant expenses. For example, Shell committed \$80 million
on top of Act 2 funds to clean up environmental contamination at the
site and prepare the land for construction of the Complex
[@cocklin2016b, ¶6]. A PennDOT spokesman, said Shell paid for a \$60
million project to alter a Commonwealth roadway, Pennsylvania Route 18,
and make other road fixes at the site [@bumsted2016]. Also, Shell paid
nearly \$70 million to move Center Township's water intake site and
build Township a new water treatment plant. The water intake was located
where Shell built docking facilities for delivery of equipment during
the construction phase of the Complex (@cocklin2016c, para. 4).

##### Tax Expenditures Offered as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offered major incentives for siting the
Complex in Pennsylvania:

-   *Act 16 in 2012* [@keystone] makes Shell exempt from all corporate
    net income taxes and property taxes for 25 years after first
    occupying the Beaver County site, as long as it invests at least one
    billion dollars (not necessarily in Pennsylvania) and creates at
    least 400 new permanent full-time jobs. Shell said it would deploy
    600 jobs to operate the Complex [@pennsylv, "Environment and
    society"].
-   *Act 85 in 2012* [@taxrefo] gives Shell a tax credit of 5 cents for
    every gallon of ethane it buys to manufacture ethylene, provided
    that 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs are created during construction
    of the Complex (≅6,000 were, according to Shell [@shellst]). Shell
    pays no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but Shell can benefit by
    selling unused credits as tax equity for other purchasing firms to
    reduce their own tax liability.

Thomas Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought an
annual \$66 million tax credit for 25 years, a total of \$1.65 billion.
If the Complex sustains between 400 to 600 jobs annually for 25 years, a
rough, undiscounted calculation[^2] indicates a cost per job over the
25-year period between \$2.75 million and \$.13 million, which equals
\$165,000 to \$112,000 per job per year. The dollar figure was not
placed in the final draft of legislation, meaning that the credits are
unlimited and flexible [@bumsted2012]. Shell's Visser said "I can tell
you, with hand to my heart, that without these incentives, we would not
have made this investment decision [@cocklin2016a, ¶6]."

[^2]: And, my own. So quite unofficial.

#### Is the Complex Expected to Improve the Regional Economy?

### Operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven
ethane cracker units, one high density polyethylene and two low density
polyethylene resin manufacturing units, a natural gas-fired combustion
turbine, four emergency diesel generators, multiple fuel and storage
tanks, multiple flaring units and an incinerator
[@stateofpennsylvania2016, pp. 5-7]. Displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-processF) are inputs, processes, and products of the
Complex. For simplicity of presentation, the flow of activity portrayed
in Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) skims over many of the details of the
ethane-to-ethylene-to-plastic resin process. I narrate some of the
details about inputs, processes, and outputs that are behind Figure
\@ref(fig:img-processF).

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ProcessFlow.png")
```

#### Inputs

The Complex is anticipated to produce 3.9 million barrels of ethane
annually by cracking ethane molecules to make ethylene [@sanzillo2020,
p. 7].[^3] All of the ethane required by the Complex is delivered to the
Complex by the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System, a 97-mile pipeline network
from Houston, Pennsylvania, and Cadiz and Scio in Ohio. The three modes
in the pipeline network are tactically located proximal to clusters of
wells producing "wet" gas[^4] (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-falcon)).[^5] At
these three nodes are gas processing plants that drop out liquids and
remove solids or other particulate matter that might exist in the gas
stream lifted from regional wells drawing from Marcellus and Utica shale
formations. As with many aspects of the construction and operation of
the Complex, the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System has generated
considerable controversy [see, e.g., @realtal2022].

[^3]: I caution that the magnitude of figures about the supply of inputs
    to the Complex and its outputs were offered by Shell before
    initiation of the project and will depend on market conditions that
    drive Complex activity.

[^4]: That is, wells that not only produce methane, but also produce
    natural gas liquids such as ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane.
    Molecules of these substances are have higher molecular weight than
    methane. These products constitute as liquids when, depending on the
    gas pressure, they condense to become the "wet," portion of the
    natural gas [@hey2017]. In general, Marcellus and Utica shale
    formations in Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, and West Virginia
    contain high proportions of wet gas.

[^5]: Figure from @shells2017.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/Falcon-Ethane-Pipeline.png")
```

Superheated pressurized steam in the cracker vaporizes ethane. Heat
splits the bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms in ethane to yield
ethylene (more detail in @passmore2022a, para, 5). *Oil & Gas Journal*
[@brelsford2021] reported that the Complex also will draw 20 million
gallons of water every day from the Ohio River. Some water not used to
generate steam is used to cool the effluent produced by the cracker.
Water is reused or returned to the river as a by-product[^6] after
treatment to meet water quality standards.

[^6]: A by-products is a material produced as a residual of, or
    incidental to, the production process. In an accounting sense,
    by-products are associated with costs.

Natural gas fires a 250-megawatt turbine that produces steam for the
ethane cracker and generates electricity for the Complex. The local
electrical grid could buy one-third of the electricity output of the
power plant [@newshel].

#### Processes

The core of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex is an ethane cracker
that supplies ethylene for making polymer resin.

##### Cracking

An ethane cracker is a furnace into which ethane is fed. The ethane is
diluted with with steam that is heated to 1300° F. The heat of the
furnace cracks ethylene (C$_{2}$H$_{4}$) from ethane (C$_{2}$H$_{6}$)
molecules, freeing two molecules of hydrogen in the process and creating
a double bond between carbon atoms [^7] between carbon atoms (See Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). The hot gas mixture exhausted from the cracker is
cooled, or "quenched [@quenchw]," with water to prevent further chemical
reactions. Water is recovered for recycling back into the cracking
process, although some is treated and discharged as a by-product of the
Complex [@partlow2022].

[^7]: A a type of chemical bond in which two electron pairs are shared
    between two atoms [@helmenstinea].

```{r img-crack, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Ethane Molecules are Cracked to Form Ethylene Molecules'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/LNG-04a.jpeg")
```

Gas containing ethylene and other substances moving from the cracker is
compressed to a liquid state and, then, refrigerated. Fractional
distillation further separates ethylene from the cooled quenched mixture
by taking advantage of differences in the vaporization point of ethylene
compared with other chemical components of the mixture [@helmenstine].
Various gases that are by-products of cracking are burned off into the
air in a controlled combustion process called "flaring" [@flaring],
which releases carbon dioxide into the air as a by-product. Wastewater
from the cracker is collected, treated, and discharged. Then, the
ethylene produced is stored for use in manufacturing of plastic resins.

An important fact is that ethylene cracked from ethane is not a product
of the Complex meant to be sold to customers. Ethylene is, instead, an
input to polyethylene manufacturing, the next and final stage of
production in the Complex. Ethane cracking gathers more attention than
polymerization probably because the ethane cracker forms a large
footprint at the Complex and consumes most inputs of ethane, water,
electricity, and steam to the Complex. The final product of the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sold to customers is, in fact,
pelletized polyethylene resin. *This fact has important consequences for
the validity of estimates that have been made of economic impact of the
Complex.* More to that point subsequently in this posting.

##### Polymerization

Unique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single bonds
chemically with up to four other atoms and to double or triple bond with
itself, as in a double-bond ethylene molecule (again, see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). Carbon is one of the only elements, because of
its bonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped molecules to
form the basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
and proteins that serve as the basis of life itself. Chaining together
ethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical process called
*polymerization* produces polyethylene (a polymer, which means "many
parts").

Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in
the presence of catalyst.[^8] The catalyst bonds ethylene monomers into
a long chain forming a polymer (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-polymer)).[^9]
The polymerization process releases high amounts of heat,[^10]
continuous cooling is required to prevent runaway chemical reactions
[@burdett2018, p. 67].

[^8]: A chemical is a some material that speeds up chemical reactions,
    but is not consumed during the reaction. Approximately 95% of
    industrial chemical processes involve catalysts of various kinds.

[^9]: Figure from [@howpoly].

[^10]: Described as "exothermic."

```{r img-polymer, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Ethylene Monomers React With a Catalyst to Create Polyethylene'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/polymerization.png")
```

#### Outputs

Plastic resin is the product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
that has market value for Shell. At the same time, the Complex
accumulates by-products of its industrial processes have consequence for
the public health and environmental quality.

##### Polyethylene Resin Pellets

Polyethylene has many desirable attributes for manufacturing. According
to @kaiser2021, polyethylene can handle large loads without fracture. It
is flexible and can be stretched. Polyethylene has a relatively low
melting point compared with other plastics and absorbs no water.
Polyethylene is a good electrical insulator and can be produced to be
transparent. Polyethylene has thermoplastic properties useful in
production -- i.e., it softens or fuses when heated and hardens and
becomes rigid again when cooled.

Nearly all polyethylene typically is sold as small (≅5mm), white,
lentil-shaped pellets, although round, flat, square, cylindrical, and
various other shapes of many colors are manufactured (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-nurd)).[^11] The pellets are known as "nurdles." The added
cost of pelletizing polyethylene is considerable [@burdett2018a, p. 67].

    <https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/plastic-pellets-nurdles-pollute-oceans/593317/>.

```{r img-nurd, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , fig.cap='A Handful of Nurdles'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/nurdlehand.jpg")
```

These plastic pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in
downstream markets. Pellet prices are volatile [@pederson2021] because
they are driven on the supply side by equally volatile prices for
natural gas and on the demand side by two major factors. First,
consumers express preferences for "eco-friendly" packaging solutions.
Second, environmental regulation of plastic products is increasing. Some
observers believe nurdles are one of the most destructive toxic wastes
released in the environment (see discussion by @mcveigh).

##### By-Products

Many industrial processes create co-products and by-products.
Co-products are goods or services produced incidental to main production
that have market value to generate revenue. A by-product typically is a
material that is a consequence of production that is associated with
costs. I could not find evidence to indicate that the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex generates any co-products. However, the Complex
will create by-products, some of the cost of which Shell will bear by
paying for permits to discharge substances into the environment.

Cracking ethane emits hazardous by-products that can render the air,
soil, water, or other natural resources harmful or unsuitable for use.
Small inhalable particles (e.g., PM$_{2.5}$), another by-product of
ethane production, can damage short- and long-term human respiratory
function. Cracking also releases carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), a gas that
can absorb energy within the infrared wavelengths. This energy is
transferred by collision with other molecules. Faster molecular motion
produces heat. Trapped heat from this action of carbon dioxide in the
Earth's atmosphere is the "greenhouse effect" that has affected global
warming.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection required for
this first-of-its-kind facility in Pennsylvania complex environmental
reviews, approvals, and permits for new construction, remediation of
contamination from previous industrial activities on the property, and
operation. The Department lists news on its website (see [@pennsylvb])
about the Complex, permits and approvals obtained for the construction
and operation of the plant, and government compliance/enforcement
actions taken to regulate the Complex.
