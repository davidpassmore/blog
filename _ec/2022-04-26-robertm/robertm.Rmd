Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, a Shell subsidiary located in Houston,
Texas [@dunbradstreet], decided in 2016 after a long planning period to
invest in building and operating an ethane cracker to support a
polyethylene pellet manufacturing facility at the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex on the Ohio River in Monaca, Pennsylvania in
Beaver County [@pennsylv, "Project development"] (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crackerM)). Polyethylene is a feedstock for manufacturing
plastic products, especially plastic packaging and auto components.
Shell is reported to confirm that the Complex will start operating in
2022 @shrum2022. @gist2016 wrote that "The Shell cracker represents one of the
biggest-ever industrial investments in the tristate region
(Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), whose industrial sector
suffered a series of set-backs through the second half of the 20^th^
century (para. 4)."

```

Why Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? "The basic answer is very
simple," said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At the time, he was vice president of Appalachia petrochemicals of Shell Chemical
Appalachia. Visser said "You're sitting here on a world-class resource base at the doorstep of your customer [@cocklin2016]." Leaders of oil and gas industry associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia noted that "Our three states produce roughly one-third of America's natural gas, making Appalachia the third largest gas producer in the world -- behind only the U.S. itself and Russia" [@callahan2022]. More than 70% of North American polyethylene market exists within a 700-mile radius of the Complex [@pennsylvc, "Project development"].



In this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and information gaps that
affect^[In another posting in NOTES from Pittsburgh [@passmore2022], I summarized the chemical engineering for cracking ethane feedstock to obtain ethylene and, from there, to produce polyethylene pellets, which have downstream uses in the manufacture of many consumer products.]

### Questions Remain About the Viability of the Complex

#### Can Product & Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?

Risk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels,
products, and their derivatives. In September 2020, @moodys2020 raised
questions about the credit-worthiness of new fossil fuel projects.
Markets, regulations, and concerns about the environment and quality of
life are influencing the business proposition for added fossil fuel
capacity.

According to a biting 2020 analysis offered by by @sanzillo2020 for the
[Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis](%5Bhttps://ieefa.org/)](<https://ieefa.org/>)), the
Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex faces prospects of low product
prices, risk of oversupply of plastic resins, stiff competition from
other producers, volatility in ethane feedstock markets, the possibility
of low overall economic growth, and competition from recycled plastics
materials. Concluded by the Institute is that the Complex "will open to
market conditions that are more challenging than when the project was
planned. The [C]omplex is likely to be less profitable than expected and
face an extended period of financial distress [@sanzillo2020, p.1]."

#### Are Tax Expenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Worthy?

##### Site Preparation

Funds from *Act 2 of 1995* [@landrec], which supports remediation of
tracts of land that has been developed for industrial purposes,
polluted, and then abandoned (*aka* "brownfields"), were used to prepare
the site, the location of a former zinc smelter. Remediation involved
covering the site with clean fill, installing a synthetic cap over
previous disposal areas on the property, and collecting and treating
potentially contaminated storm water before discharge [@shellpe,]. Ate
Visser with Shell Chemical Appalachia a said that initiation of
construction of the Complex would not have been possible without Act 2
funds [@cocklin2016b, ¶7].

##### Tax Expenditures as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offered major incentives for siting the
Complex in Pennsylvania:

-   *Act 16 in 2012* [@keystone] made Shell exempt from all corporate
    net income taxes and property taxes for 15 years after first
    occupying the Beaver County site, as long as it invests at least one
    billion dollars (not necessarily in Pennsylvania) and creates at
    least 400 new permanent full-time jobs.
-   *Act 85 in 2012* [@taxrefo] gives Shell a tax credit of 5 cents for
    every gallon of ethane it buys to manufacture ethylene, provided
    that 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs are created during construction
    of the Complex (≅6,000 were, according to Shell [@shellst]). Shell
    pays no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but Shell can benefit by
    selling unused credits as tax equity for other purchasing firms to
    reduce their own tax liability.

The dollar value of these incentives is open-ended. Thomas Corbett,
Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought an annual \$66
million tax credit for 25 years, a total of \$1.65 billion. The dollar
figure was not placed in the final draft, meaning that the credits are
unlimited and flexible [@bumsted2012]. Shell's Visser said "I can tell
you, with hand to my heart, that without these incentives, we would not
have made this investment decision [@cocklin2016a, ¶6]."

Often-overlooked in discussions of incentives and credits is t

#### Is the Complex Expected to Improve the Regional Economy?

I organize the remainder of this posting around three topics:

1.  *Key features of the operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
    Complex.*
2.  *Stakes for public investments in the Complex.*
3.  *Close and critical examination of claims of economic impact of the
    Complex.*

### Operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven
ethane cracker units, one high density polyethylene and two low density
polyethylene resin manufacturing units, a natural gas-fired combustion
turbine, four emergency diesel generators, multiple fuel and storage
tanks, multiple flaring units and an incinerator
[@stateofpennsylvania2016, pp. 5-7]. Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) is a
simple display of the inputs, processes, and products of the Complex

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ProcessFlow.png")
```

#### Inputs

The Complex requires crack 3.9 million barrels of ethane annually for
cracking ethane molecules (C$_{2}$H$_{6}$) into ethylene
(C$_{2}$H$_{4}$) [@sanzillo2020, p. 7]. All of the ethane required by
the Complex is delivered by the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System, 97-mile
common carrier ethane pipeline located in Southwestern Pennsylvania and
extends into Eastern Ohio and West Virginia. Shell says it will deploy
600 jobs to operate the Complex [@pennsylv, "Environment and society"].

*Oil & Gas Journal* [@brelsford2021] described other features of the
operations of the Complex:

> The complex will recycle and reuse water in its processes, drawing
> about 20 million gal/day from the Ohio River. While about 80% of water
> used at the site will evaporate as clean steam, the rest will be
> treated as necessary to remove impurities and tested to ensure it
> meets water quality standards before supplies are returned to the
> river.

> Already set to be equipped with the most recent (but
> yet-to-be-identified) technologies to maximize energy efficiency and
> minimize emissions, Shell said the complex also will feature secondary
> measures to limit emissions from the site.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection required for
this first-of-its-kind facility in Pennsylvania several complex
environmental reviews, approvals, and permits for new construction,
remediation of contamination from previous industrial activities on the
property, and operation. The Department lists news on its website (see
[@pennsylvb]) about the Complex, permits and approvals obtained for the
construction and operation of the plant, and government
compliance/enforcement actions taken to regulate the Complex.
