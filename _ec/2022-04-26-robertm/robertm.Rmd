Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, a Shell subsidiary located in Houston,
Texas [@dunbradstreet], decided in 2016 after a long planning period to
invest in building and operating an ethane cracker to support
polyethylene resin manufacturing in southwestern Pennsylvania
[@shelltaa]. The 386-acre Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex (Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crackerM)) is adjacent to the Ohio River in Potter and
Center townships near the borough of Monaca in Beaver County,
Pennsylvania [@pennsylv, "Project development"]. Polyethylene is a
feedstock for manufacturing plastic products, especially packaging and
auto components. Polyethylene is produced from ethylene created from
steam processing of ethane, a natural gas liquid found in some gas
streams in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ethane_cracker.jpeg")
```

Shell has confirmed that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will
commence operations in 2022 [@shrum2022]. In December 2021, a Shell
Chemical Appalachia executive was reported to have said that "Much of
the work is done....Now we are tying the various larger structures
together" [@suttles2020]. One estimate places the cost of the Complex at
\$10 billion [@schneider2019].

Why Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? "The basic answer is very
simple," said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At
the time, Visser was an executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia. Visser
said "You're sitting here on a world-class resource base at the doorstep
of your customer [@cocklin2016]." Â 

Leaders of oil and gas industry associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia noted that "Our three states produce roughly one-third of
America's natural gas, making Appalachia the third largest gas producer
in the world -- behind only the U.S. itself and Russia" [@callahan2022].
More than 70% of North American polyethylene market exists within a
700-mile radius of the Complex [@pennsylvc, "Project development"].

@gist2016 wrote that "The Shell cracker represents one of the
biggest-ever industrial investments in the tristate region
(Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), whose industrial sector
suffered a series of set-backs through the second half of the 20th
century (para. 4)." \@whitfield2018 described a study [@reporta2017][^1]
for the Team Pennsylvania Foundation [@teampa] that predicted
"significant new investments in energy infrastructure such as gas
gathering lines, pipelines, storage facilities, and fractionation plants
(para. 3). In 2019, a visiting President Trump remarked that "These
folks are from Shell, and this is a plant like no other. It's just
incredible....And we appreciate the investment, and we're going to do
everything possible to make [inaudible -- perhaps, *it successful?*]
[@remarks2019]."

[^1]: "The full report has never been released to the public," wrote
    @sanzillo2020a (p. 3). Although the report has been cited widely by
    government, corporate, business associations and media, only the
    executive summary has been publicly released. The authors of the
    report confirmed that their report was withheld "on the grounds that
    it only released the full study to entities with a commercial
    interest" [@sanzillo2020b, p. 3].

Shell stuck with its decision to invest in the Complex, even though many
Shell projects worldwide were delayed, resized or canceled altogether
due to a downturn in the oil and gas markets as the Complex project
commenced [@davis2016].

### In This Blog Posting....

In the remainder of this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and gaps in
information that could influence the perceptions of the economic impact
of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.[^2] The flow of this blog
posting follows three threads:

[^2]: In another posting in NOTES from Pittsburgh [@passmore2022], I
    summarized the chemical engineering for cracking ethane feedstock to
    obtain ethylene and, from there, to produce polyethylene resin
    pellets, which have downstream uses to manufacture many consumer
    products.

-   I, first, delineate some of the questions that remain for me about
    the markets affecting the Complex, the worthiness of public
    expenditures on the Complex, and the regional economic effects that
    the public expects from the operation of the Complex. I highlight
    the importance of evidence about expected economic impact to promote
    public acceptance of the Complex and to stimulate the need for
    public expenditures to support the Complex.\
-   Next, I outline my simple understanding of the steps in the
    operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Understanding
    these the nature and structure of inputs, processes, and outputs
    shapes expectations for the regional economic impact of the
    Complex.\
-   And, last, I critically examine a report by professors associated
    with Robert Morris University that was prepared for Shell Chemical
    Appalachia LLC [@clinton2021a]. This report, *Updated Economic
    Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County,
    Pennsylvania*, was produced before the Complex was commissioned.
    Although the the report is described as information, many readers
    might consider the information in the report as persuasive evidence
    responding to the public's questions about the potential impact of
    the Complex on the regional economy.

By the way, read my manifesto, *My Point of View*, in an appendix to
this posting for a brief statement of my motivations and approach to
writing this blog essay.

### Questions Remain About the Viability of the Complex

#### Can Product & Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?

Risk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels and
products derived from these fuels. In September 2020, @moodys2020 raised
questions about the credit-worthiness of new fossil fuel projects.
Markets, regulations, and environmental concerns affecting quality of
human life are influencing the viability of the business proposition for
added fossil fuel capacity.

According to a biting 2020 opinion offered by @sanzillo2020 for the
[Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis](https://ieefa.org/),[^3] the Pennsylvania Petrochemical
Complex faces prospects of low product prices, price and supply
volatility in ethane feedstock markets, risk of oversupply of
polyethylene resins that the Complex will manufacture, stiff competition
from other producers, competition from the supply of recycled plastics
materials, and the influence of possible low general economic growth.
Concluded by the Institute was that the Complex "will open to market
conditions that are more challenging than when the project was planned.
The [C]omplex is likely to be less profitable than expected and face an
extended period of financial distress [@sanzillo2020, p.1; see, also,
@bruggers2020]."

    energy economy.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/natgaspr.png")
```

#### Tax Expenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Are Large...But Prudent?

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allocated funds to support preparation
of the site for the Complex in Monaca. In addition, the Commonwealth
offered tax and financial incentives to site the Complex in
Pennsylvania. Use of the term, "incentives," however, makes the
Commonwealth's decision sound distant from its financial accounting.
Make no mistake, though. These incentives plainly are *tax
expenditures*, defined in an accounting sense by the U.S. Treasury
[@taxexpe; see, also, @hellerstein1966, p. 793] as

> revenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which
> allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income
> or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a
> deferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as
> alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or
> regulatory programs. (para. 1)

As a consequence of excluding taxes and offering tax credits for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, citizens of the Commonwealth forego
the opportunity to collect general fund revenue. Also, reduction of
revenue from these expenditures and credits could require the
Commonwealth to raise taxes to remain revenue-neutral [@sammartino2020,
p. 4]. In 2019, Stacker, a news organization, calculated that the tax
breaks allocated to the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex ranked 13th
in dollar value out of 50 national projects receiving corporate
subsidies from governments over a 20-year period [@crisafulli].

If projects were judged on costs alone, few investments would be made,
of course. Rather, citizens must weigh the costs of this public
investment in this private venture against the benefits distributed to
the regional economy that could accrue from the operation of the
Complex. As I will assert in more detail subsequently in this blog
posting, I do not believe that these benefits were demonstrated well
before operation of the Complex.

##### Expenditures on Site Preparation

Funds from *Act 2 of 1995* [@landrec] -- which supports remediation of
tracts of land that were developed for industrial purposes, polluted,
and then abandoned (*aka* "brownfields") -- funded a portion of costs of
preparation of the site, the location of a former zinc smelter.
Remediation involved covering the site with clean fill, installing a
synthetic cap over previous disposal areas on the property, and
collecting and treating potentially contaminated storm water before
discharge [@shellpe]. Ate Visser speaking for Shell at a 2016 industry
conference in Pittsburgh said that construction of the Complex would
been impossible without Act 2 funds [@cocklin2016b, Â¶7].

Commonwealth expenditures did not alone fund site preparation. Shell
incurred significant expenses. For example, Shell committed \$80 million
on top of Act 2 funds to clean up environmental contamination at the
site and prepare the land for construction of the Complex
[@cocklin2016b, Â¶6]. A PennDOT spokesman, said Shell paid for a \$60
million project to alter a Commonwealth roadway, Pennsylvania Route 18,
and make other road fixes at the site [@bumsted2016]. Also, Shell paid
nearly \$70 million to move Center Township's water intake site and
build Township a new water treatment plant. The water intake was located
where Shell built docking facilities for delivery of equipment during
the construction phase of the Complex [@cocklin2016c, Â¶4].

##### Tax Expenditures Offered as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offered major incentives for siting
petrochemical plants such as the Complex in Pennsylvania:

-   *Act 16 in 2012* [@keystone] makes petrochemical manufacturers like
    Shell exempt from all corporate net income taxes and property taxes
    for 15 years after first occupying the Beaver County site, as long
    as it invests at least one billion dollars (not necessarily in
    Pennsylvania) and creates at least 400 new permanent full-time jobs.
    Shell said it would deploy 600 jobs to operate the Complex
    [@pennsylv, "Environment and society"].\
-   *Act 85 in 2012* [@taxrefo, "Article XVII-G"] gives Shell a tax
    credit of 5 cents for every gallon of ethane it buys to manufacture
    ethylene, provided that 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs are created
    during construction of the Complex (â6,000 were, according to Shell
    [@shellst]). Shell will pay no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but
    Shell can benefit by selling unused credits as tax equity for other
    purchasing firms to reduce their own tax liability.

```{r img-acts, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Pennsylvania Act 16 and Act 85 <br> (Images captured  from www.legis.state.pa.us website and edited by David Passmore)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/actsofcorbett.jpg")
```

Thomas Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought an
annual \$66 million tax credit for 25 years, a total of \$1.65 billion.
If the Complex sustains between 400 to 600 jobs annually for 25 years, a
rough, undiscounted calculation[^4] indicates a cost per job, a
recognized economic development metric (@sahota; see, also
@ukhomescommunitiesagency2015), over the 25-year period between \$2.75
million and \$.13 million, which equals \$165,000 to \$112,000 per job
per year. A dollar figure capping expenditures was not placed in the
final draft of legislation, meaning that the credits are unlimited and
flexible [@bumsted2012]. Shell's Visser said "I can tell you, with hand
to my heart, that without these incentives, we would not have made this
investment decision [@cocklin2016a, Â¶6]." Governor Corbett, who steered
these expenditures through legislation, said that "When you're looking
at the investment you have to look at what it would have cost us had we
done nothing, had we let these businesses go" [@detrow2012].

[^4]: And, my own calculation. So quite unofficial.

The extant research literature examining the relationship between
offering tax incentives and consequent economic growth is complex,
varied, and inconclusive [@buss2001a, pp. 94-100]. In particular,
evidence is weak that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader
economic growth at the state and local levels [@slattery2020].
@bartik2020 reported that so-called "place-based" policies cost around
\$60 billion annually (in 2019 dollars) and that the typical state and
local incentive offer, as a percent of the value-added of the business
receiving an incentive, tripled in size between in the 30 years
preceding 2019.

The body of research is thin about the economic growth that resulted
from using state and local expenditures of tax revenue to subsidize
private firms, State governments prefer not to conduct rigorous
evaluations the costs and benefits of tax expenditures used to incent
site location decisions [@buss2001]. An open question is whether firms
would decide to relocate to a region even without incentives, especially
if the region offers unique and desirable business opportunities. As far
as I know, the Commonwealth has not embarked on an assessment of Act 16
and Act 85 expenditures. The net public benefit of tax expenditures on
the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex remains to be demonstrated.

#### Is the Complex Expected to Change the Regional Economy?

##### Shell's Stake, Different Than the Public's

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sums to a massive long-term
investment in money, time, effort, and planning by Shell. Shell
undoubtedly foresees a financial return from investing in the Complex,
even though the Complex will face the vagaries of resource and product
markets and emerging regulation, as will any forward-looking decision in
the energy sector. Shell makes decisions as a private enterprise with
shared ownership among stockholders. As such Shell properly necessarily
must invoke the criterion of "what's in it for us and, ultimately, our
shareholders" in its decisions.

Deep inside the company's spreadsheets, Shell must have weighed on a
finely-tuned scale the current and future costs, risks, uncertainties,
revenue, and profits in the balance of its worldwide business efforts to
yield the momentous decision to move forward with the Complex.
Proceeding to build and operate the Complex was a complex, bold, and
courageous business decision made by one of the largest independent
energy firms in the world. Much is at stake for Shell.

Shell's success also could translate to a positive impact on the
regional economy in proportion that the inputs purchased for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex originate in the region and its
outputs are sold and used subsequently for manufacturing in the region.
Such an impact on the regional economy is, however, incidental and is
not essential for Shell's financial success with the Complex. Obtaining
a return from the Commonwealth's tax expenditures is, essential for
Pennsylvania citizens, though. The Commonwealth tax expenditures reduce
Shell's costs in exchange for modest job and investment possibilities
derived in the short term by construction and in the long term by
operation of the Complex.

##### The Public's Interest, Different Than Shell's

Through the Commonwealth's expenditures of tax revenues, Pennsylvania
citizens have become significant financial stakeholders in the Complex.
Yet, measures of success expected from the Complex by Pennsylvania
citizens are not the same as Shell's. Citizens seek regional economic
impact from their investments in the form of jobs and income for
citizens and tax revenue for governments to fund public goods and
services. Commonwealth and local tax collection from Shell were foregone
by state legislation, however.

These expenditures of tax revenues for Shell and other energy companies
came at the same time as reduced Pennsylvania spending for county-level
public health programs and other public services and an across-the-board
\$1 billion cut in state spending [@detrow2012a, para. 2]**.** In
addition, negotiations about these expenditures remained hidden from
public view due to confidentiality agreements with Shell
[@phillips2012]. Governor Thomas Corbett,

> "Pushed back against the argument the tax break is a corporate
> giveaway, saying, 'They think we're giving money to them. No we're
> not. What we're saying is, you build it. You provide all these jobs
> for all these people. And we'll take a little less money from you, so
> we have more money for us.' " [@detrow2012e]

Any enterprise engaging in business transactions -- even an enterprise
so primitive as a child's lemonade stand -- generates an economic
impact. So, there is no doubt that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex will have some impact on the regional economy. But, how much?
When? Will the benefits of regional economic impact cover the costs of
expenditures of revenue collected from Pennsylvania citizens? Answers to
these critical questions about the public benefits of the Complex might
justify expenditures on the Complex by Pennsylvania citizens.

##### Evidence Asserting Potential Regional Impact That Was Influential in Planning Stages

Without a doubt, several reports from the American Chemistry Council, a
trade association,[^5] framed the potential benefits of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex for Pennsylvania citizens, their elected
legislators, and public officials. In 2011, the Council reported
[@americanchemistrycouncil2011, p. 1] that a 25 percent increase in
ethane supply on growth in the petrochemical sector would generate
17,000 new knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs in the U.S. chemical
industry and 395,000 additional jobs outside the chemical industry. Also
concluded was that this investment would generate \$4.4 billion more in
federal, state, and local tax revenue,annually (\$43.9 billion over 10
years).

[^5]: The American Chemistry Council defines itself as "America's oldest
    trade association of its kind, representing more than 190 companies
    engaged in the business of chemistry -- an innovative, economic
    growth engine that is helping to solve the biggest challenges facing
    our country and the world. Our members are the leading companies
    engaged in all aspects of the business of chemistry, from the
    largest corporations to the smallest, and everything in between"
    [@aboutac].

In 2012, the American Chemistry Council issued an addendum to their
national report that focused on the economic impact of natural gas
development in Pennsylvania. The Council asserted that an additional
\$4.8 billion in chemical industry activity would generate over 2,400
high-paying, desirable jobs in the Pennsylvania chemical industry
[@americanchemistrycouncil2012, para. 4]. In addition, new petrochemical
production in Pennsylvania would generate purchases of raw materials,
services, and other purchases throughout the supply chain, producing]
more than 8,200 indirect jobs, generate 7,000 payroll-induced jobs in
the state. The one-time \$3.2 billion investment in a Pennsylvania
petrochemical complex would result in more than \$900 million in
spending inside the state of Pennsylvania
[@americanchemistrycouncil2012b, para. 6]Â 

The Council also asserted that construction of a petrochemical facility,
purchase of new equipment for the facility, and operation of the
facility would result in federal and state tax revenues of \$363 million
and local tax revenues of \$141 million [@americanchemistrycouncil2012c,
Table 3 and Table 4].

These reports were influential at the front edge of the advancing
natural gas revolution, the "pivot of world's energy future"
[@kolb2014], in Pennsylvania and other states in the northeast of the
United States. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not conduct its own
independent study of the potential economic impact of ethane cracking
and plastic resin production in Pennsylvania [@detrow2012b] -- nor did
it finish its own study in time to affect legislation of tax
expenditures [@detrow2012c, para. 10]. Pennsylvania Governor Thomas
Corbett said that he trusted the American Chemistry Council's estimates
of potential economic impact [@detrow2012d].

The American Chemical Society's reports about the potential economic
impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex were the linchpins in
the appeal that secured allocation of tax expenditures through Act 16
and Act 85 to support the construction and operation of the Complex.
However, questions still remain about the validity of the American
Chemical Society estimates of the potential economic impact of the
Complex and, therefore, whether the reports demonstrated the potential
benefits from Pennsylvania citizens' investment in the Complex.

A more recent report, *Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical
Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021], written by
professors associated with Robert Morris University for Shell Chemical
Appalachia LLC was released in 2021. This report was meant to provide
evidence to satisfy questions about the expected impact of the Complex
on the regional economy before the Complex is commissioned in 2022.

I believe that the report produced by Robert Morris University
researchers did not reduce uncertainty that remained about the wisdom of
tax expenditures on the Complex. In fact, I assert that conceptual and
methodological flaws in the reports from the American Chemistry Council
and Robert Morris rendered reports' conclusions suspect and, therefore,
negated their usefulness for justifying public expenditures to support
the construction and operation of the Complex. I do *not* deny that
regional economic benefits will flow from the Complex, just that the
reports were inadequate to uphold decisions made to allocate public
expenditure for the Complex.

I defer to the last major section of this blog posting my criticisms of
the recent report from Robert Morris University, criticisms that I
believe apply similarly for the almost decade-old American Chemical
Society reports. Necessarily prior, though, to motivate my criticisms is
a common understanding the inputs, processes, and outputs form the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. So,next, I offer my bare bones
description of the operation of the Complex and refer to information in
this description in my subsequent review the Robert Morris report.

### Operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven
ethane cracker units,[^6] one high density polyethylene and two low
density polyethylene resin manufacturing units (potential of 1,600,000
metric tons of polyethylene annually), natural gas-fired combustion
turbines, four emergency diesel generators, diesel-powered pumps,
cooling towers, multiple fuel and storage tanks, multiple flaring units,
an incinerator, air pollution control devices, and a wastewater
treatment facility [see @rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014 and
@stateofpennsylvania2016, pp. 5-7]. Displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-processF) are inputs, processes, and products of the
Complex. For simplicity of presentation, the flow of activity portrayed
in Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) skims over many of the details of the
ethane-to-ethylene-to-plastic resin process. I narrate some of the
details about inputs, processes, and outputs that flow from top to
bottom of Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF).

[^6]: Six in operation, while a seventh undergoes maintenance.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ProcessFlow.png")
```

#### Inputs

The Complex will have the capacity to produce 1.5 million metric tons of
ethane annually by cracking ethane molecules to make ethylene
[@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014, p. 1-2].[^7] All of the ethane
required is delivered to the Complex by the Falcon Ethane Pipeline
System, a 97-mile pipeline network incoming to the Complex from Houston,
Pennsylvania, and Cadiz and Scio in Ohio. (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-falcon)). As with many aspects of the construction and
operation of the Complex, the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System has
generated considerable controversy [see, e.g., @realtal2022].

[^7]: The document, *Air Quality Plan Approval Application:
    Petrochemicals Complex, Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, Beaver
    County, Pennsylvania* [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014], is the
    best source of information I have found about the processes applied
    and emissions of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Therefore
    I cite this application frequently in this blog posting. The
    application is Shell's official description of the Complex offered
    to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The
    Department issued a permit in 2015
    [@commonwealthofpennsylvania2015], which was valid through 2019. I
    am not aware of a renewal of this permit and any process or emission
    updates that a renewal application might cite.

```{r img-falcon, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.width='25%' , out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Falcon Ethane Pipeline. <br> (Map from https://bit.ly/FalconPipeline)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/Falcon-Ethane-Pipeline.png")
```

At these three nodes in the pipeline network are gas processing plants
that separate liquids and remove solids or other particulate matter in
the gas stream lifted from regional wells drawing from Marcellus and
Utica shale formations. The three modes are tactically located proximal
to clusters of wells producing "wet" gas. Some wells not only produce
natural gas as methane, but also include natural gas liquids such as
ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane. These products constitute as
liquids when, depending on the gas pressure, they condense to become the
"wet," portion of the natural gas [@hey2017]. In general, Marcellus and
Utica shale formations in Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, and West
Virginia involve wet gas (See Figure \@ref(fig:img-wet) for locations).

```{r img-wet, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2, out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='Locations of Wet and Dry Gas in Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations. <br> (Map from https://bit.ly/wet-dry-gas)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/wetdry.jpg")
```

Natural-gas-fired cogeneration turbines will produce steam for the
ethane cracker and will generate electricity for the Complex. Excess
electricity generated through cogeneration will be sold for distribution
in daily energy markets run by the PJM Interconnection electrical power
grid serving selected northeastern U.S. states
[@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014, p. 1-2]. As much as one-third of
the electricity output of the cogeneration units might become available
for regional distribution [@newshel].

Superheated pressurized steam in the cracker dilutes and vaporizes
ethane. Heat from the steam splits the bonds between carbon and hydrogen
atoms in ethane, a process called "pyrolysis," to yield ethylene (more
detail in @passmore2022a, para, 5).

*Oil & Gas Journal* [@brelsford2021] reported that the Complex also will
draw 20 million gallons of water every day from the Ohio River. Some
water not used to generate steam is used to cool the effluent produced
by the cracker or to contribute to other processes at the Complex. Water
is reused or returned to the river as a by-product after treatment to
meet water quality standards. A by-product is a material produced as a
residual of, or incidental to, the production process. In an accounting
sense, by-products are associated with costs.

Unknown are the amounts and kinds of other inputs to the Complex beyond
ethane, natural gas, and water, although these other inputs could add to
the costs of business of the Complex and affect the supply chain for the
complex in similarly unknown ways.

#### Processes

At the core of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex are ethane
crackers that supply ethylene for making polymer resin extruded as
pellets.

##### Cracking

An ethane cracker is a furnace into which ethane is fed. The ethane is
diluted with with steam that is heated to 1300Â° F. The heat of the
furnace cracks ethylene from ethane molecules, freeing two molecules of
hydrogen in the process and creating a double bond[^8] between carbon
atoms. The hot gas mixture exhausted from the cracker is cooled, or
"quenched [@quenchw]," with water to prevent further chemical reactions.
Water is recovered for recycling back into the cracking process,
although some is treated and discharged as a by-product of the Complex
[@partlow2022].

[^8]: A a type of chemical bond in which two electron pairs are shared
    between two atoms [@helmenstinea].

```{r img-crack, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external", out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Comparison of the Chemical Structures of Ethane and Ethylene. <br> (Image from https://insights.globalspec.com/images/assets/490/1490/LNG-04a.jpg)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/LNG-04a.jpeg")
```

Ethylene and other substances exhausting in a gaseous state from the
cracker are compressed to a liquid state and, then, refrigerated.
Fractional distillation further separates ethylene from the cooled,
quenched mixture by taking advantage of differences in the vaporization
point of ethylene compared with other chemical components of the mixture
[@helmenstine].

Various gases that are by-products of cracking are burned off into the
air in a controlled combustion process called "flaring" [@flaring],
which releases carbon dioxide into the air as a by-product. Wastewater
also containing by-products from the cracker is collected, treated, and
discharged. Then, the ethylene produced is stored for use in
manufacturing of plastic resins.

An important observation is that ethylene cracked from ethane is not
reported to be a product of the Complex that is meant to be sold to
customers. Its sole use is for cracking. Liquification of ethylene not
used in polyethylene production is possible, but not indicated for the
Complex.[^9] I have not found any indication that Shell will produce
ethylene as a co-product of the Complex.

[^9]: I uncovered only a figure described as a "generalized graphic"
    that indicated that liquefied ethylene is a possible co-product for
    export from an ethane cracker [@petroche]. Although the graphic does
    not seem to have been designed to describe the Pennsylvania
    Petrochemical Complex in particular, it was re-purposed and applied
    to indicate the probable plant/process layout of the Complex.
    Shell's *Air Quality Plan Approval Application*
    [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014] does not identify liquefied
    ethylene as a product of the Complex.

Shell indicated that some co-products, such as "Solid components
(coke/pitch/tar) are removed...and sent offsite for either use or
disposal [and]....tar and light gasoline [are}...shipped offsite for
further processing into products" [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014,
p. 3-4], although the volume of these co-products is not reported.
Co-products are goods or services produced incidental to main production
that have market value to generate revenue. A by-product typically is a
material that is a consequence of production that is associated with
costs.

Ethylene produced at the Complex is input to polyethylene manufacturing,
the next and final stage of production in the Complex. Ethane cracking
gathers more attention than polymerization probably because the ethane
cracker forms a large footprint at the Complex and consumes most inputs
of ethane, water, electricity, and steam to the Complex. The final
product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sold to customers is,
in fact, pelletized polyethylene resin, not ethylene. *The nature of the
final product manufactured at the Complex has important consequences for
the validity of estimates made of economic impact of the Complex.* More
to that point subsequently in this blog posting.

##### Polymerization

Unique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single
chemical bonds with up to four other atoms and to double or triple bond
with itself, as in a double-bond ethylene molecule (again, see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). Carbon is one of the only elements, because of
its bonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped molecules to
form the basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
and proteins that serve as the basis of life itself. Chaining together
ethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical process called
*polymerization* produces polyethylene (a polymer, which means "many
parts").

Polyethylene production is initiated by a catalyst suspended with
ethylene molecules under pressure. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds
up chemical reactions, but is not consumed during the reaction. The
catalyst bonds ethylene monomers into a long chain forming a polymer
(see Figure \@ref(fig:img-polymer)). The polymerization process releases
high amounts of heat.[^10] As a consequence, continuous cooling is
required to prevent runaway chemical reactions [@burdett2018, p. 67].
After inclusion of additives and further conditioning, the polymer is
extruded to form pellets, the primary product of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex.

[^10]: More technically, an *exothermic reaction*.

```

#### Outputs

Plastic resin in pellet form is the product of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex that has market value for Shell. At the same
time, the Complex accumulates by-products of its industrial processes
have consequence for the public health and environmental quality.

##### Polyethylene Resin Pellets

Polyethylene has many desirable attributes for manufacturing. According
to @kaiser2021, polyethylene can handle large loads without fracture.
This material is flexible and can be stretched. Polyethylene has a
relatively low melting point compared with other plastics and absorbs no
water.

Polyethylene is a good electrical insulator and can be produced to be
transparent. Polyethylene has thermoplastic properties useful in
production -- i.e., it softens or fuses when heated and hardens and
becomes rigid again when cooled. The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
will produce high density and low density polyethylene (see,
respectively, @whatis and @lowdens).

Nearly all polyethylene is sold as small (â5mm), white, lentil-shaped
pellets (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-nurd)), although round, flat, square,
cylindrical, and various other shapes of many colors are manufactured.
The pellets are known as "nurdles." Nurdles are bagged and stored before
distribution by rail or truck to warehouses or directly to customers.
The added cost of pelletizing polyethylene is considerable
[@burdett2018b, p. 67], but nurdles are relatively easy to ship.
Customers who buy pellets are not households, but are other businesses
which use the nurdles in their own production.

```{r img-nurd, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external", out.width='25%' , fig.cap='White Nurdles. <br> (Photo from https://bit.ly/WhiteNurdles)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/polypro.jpg")
```

Plastic resin pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in
downstream markets. Pellet prices are volatile [@pederson2021] because
they are driven on the supply side by equally volatile prices for
natural gas and on the demand side by two major factors. First,
consumers express preferences for "eco-friendly" packaging solutions.
Second, environmental regulation of plastic products is increasing. Some
observers believe nurdles are one of the most destructive toxic wastes
released in the environment (see discussion by @mcveigh).

##### By-Products

Many industrial processes create co-products and by-products.[^11] The
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will generate electricity and,
perhaps, some output of cracking as co-products. However, the Complex
will create by-products, the cost of which Shell will bear, in part, by
paying for permits to discharge substances into the environment. Other
costs of by-products might be borne separately by Pennsylvania citizens
or jointly with Shell.

[^11]: Again, co-products are goods or services produced incidental to
    main production that have market value to generate revenue. A
    by-product is a material produced as a residual of, or incidental
    to, the production process. In an accounting sense, by-products are
    associated with costs.

Cracking ethane emits by-products that can render the air, soil, water,
or other natural resources unsuitable for use or harmful. The
@environmentallawinstitute and @doyle inventoried many of the
by-products of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex that could pose
threats to human health and environmental safety.

Small inhalable particles emitted can damage short- and long-term human
respiratory function. Volatile organic compounds emanate from cracking
such as ground-level ozone, benzene, and toluene associated with
respiratory and other health ailments. Permitted in treated wastewater
to be discharged to the Ohio River are certain levels of benzene,
benzo(a)pyrene, and vinyl chloride that are established human
carcinogens.

Cracking also releases carbon dioxide, a gas that can absorb energy
within the infrared wavelengths. This energy is transferred by collision
with other molecules. Faster molecular motion produces heat. Trapped
heat from this action of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is the
"greenhouse effect" that has influenced the long-term warming of the
planet's overall temperature.

The Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit
[@commonwealthofpennsylvania2015], valid through 2019, for the kinds and
numbers of tons of annual emissions by the Complex listed in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-emis).

```{r img-emis, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external", out.width='25%' , fig.cap='Emissions Not to be Equaled or Exceeded <br> by Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in 12-Month Period <br> (Image captured from @commonwealthofpennsylvania2015 (Section C, Restriction #005). <br> These numbers are maximums that are not permitted to be exceeded.  Shell believes that <br> the Complex is likely to emit less [@corkery2019].)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/emissionsapp.jpg")
```

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection required for
this first-of-its-kind facility in Pennsylvania complex environmental
reviews, approvals, and permits for new construction, remediation of
contamination from previous industrial activities on the property, and
operation. The Department keeps a running list of news on its website
(see @shellpea ) about the Complex, permits and approvals obtained for
the construction and operation of the facility, and
compliance/enforcement actions taken by government agencies to regulate
the Complex.

### Questions Remain About the Potential Impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex on the Regional Economy

Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC made a complex, courageous, and
consequential financial decision to build and operate the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex. Shell says that the Complex will open sometime
in 2022 [@shrum2022a]. The Commonwealth's citizens also invest with
Shell in the Complex. Foregoing current and future tax expenditures by
the Commonwealth reduced Shell's start-up costs, will subsidize
purchases of ethane for cracking, and eliminates much of Shell's state
and local tax liability.

Although Shell and the Commonwealth invest jointly in the Complex, their
investment goals differ. Shell aims to sell plastic pellets from the
Complex for a profit. The Commonwealth wishes to benefit from the impact
the Complex could have on regional jobs, income, business activity, and
tax revenue.

Shell will review its balance sheets and earnings reports to judge its
yield from the Complex. The Commonwealth certainly can review regional
economic data that will emerge to account for the observed impact of the
operation of the Complex, although I am not aware of any impact
assessment plan. Shell-sponsored forecasts of the potential economic
impact of the Complex seem to have provided for the rationale for
accepting the Commonwealth's decision to invest in the Complex. However,
*potential* â  *realized outcome*.

I believe that reports about the forecasts made public by Shell might
have included conceptual orientations and methodological approaches that
left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of potential
economic impact. Therefore, some assessment is appropriate of the value
of Shell's forecasts of potential impact to justify Pennsylvania
citizens' trust in investment in the Complex.

In this major section of this blog posting, I critically review a recent
report about the potential regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex. The preparation of this report, *Updated
Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County,
Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021], was supported by Shell Chemical Appalachia
LLC. The importance of this report is that some in the public might
perceive that it satisfies questions about regional economic value of
the Complex.[^12]

[^12]: @sanzillo2020c reported that Robert Morris University professors
    completed an earlier report for Shell in 2014. Shell informed them
    "that the report is not 'externally available' (p. 4)," even though
    the unreleased report was quoted extensively by independent media
    sources. @sanzillo2020c concluded that "The company has clearly
    decided not to disclose basic information about its project---not
    even how much the plant will cost (p. 4)."

When the Robert Morris report[^13] was released in 2021, the report's
authors were identified as faculty members in the School of Business at
[Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/academics/schools/sbus).
Earlier similarly produced economic impact reports by the American
Chemistry Council appeared while the Pennsylvania legislature was
considering incentives through tax expenditures to aid the construction
and operation of the Complex. I believe that these Council reports share
nearly the same methodology and analytics, as well as some of the same
issues, evident in the Robert Morris report by @clinton2021. Dissection
of the Robert Morris report also can shed light on the American
Chemistry Council reports' validity.

[^13]: I will refer in the remainder of this blog posting to the report,
    *Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver
    County, Pennsylvania,* as the "Robert Morris report." In making this
    assignment, I realize that I might promote the error of conflating
    the personal work of a team of professors with the official position
    of Robert Morris University. In 1940, the American Association of
    University Professors (AAUP), affirmed the "free search for truth
    and its free exposition" [@1940sta2006, para. 1] of faculty
    researchers. Faculty research findings are not necessarily
    university conclusions. As this independence of expression is
    executed, the AAUP enjoined faculty researchers that they "should be
    accurate at all times" [@1940sta2006, item 3 in "Academic Freedom"].
    I am not suggesting that the authors of the Robert Morris report hid
    behind an often-assumed cloak of endorsement from Robert Morris
    University itself or that their work was not accurate. Rather, my
    point is to separate Robert Morris University as a locus for this
    research from the methods chosen by the researchers and the findings
    they reached. The blending of the aims and conclusions of
    researchers with their employing institutions is common in
    discussion of the potential economic impact of Pennsylvania natural
    gas development and production. Rose Baker and I discussed problems
    created by referring to forecasts funded by the Marcellus Shale
    Coalition of the economic impact of Pennsylvania natural gas
    development and production as the "Penn State studies"
    [@passmore2011].

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/rm_cover.jpg")
```

I structure my critical review of the Robert Morris report along three
lines:

-   *Summary.* First, I summarize the Robert Morris report, accompanied
    by light annotation about some of the methods applied to generate
    the report.
-   *Issues.* Next, I identify four issues in the Robert Morris report
    that left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of the
    potential economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
    Complex: (a) specification of the geography for impact; (b)
    classification of the industry accounting for impact; (c)
    identification of Indirect Impact; and (d) appropriateness of a
    40-year forecast of impact.
-   *Next Steps.* Last, I describe briefly some ways that might prove
    useful for assessing any regional economic impact of the Complex. As
    far as I know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform such any
    impact assessment.

#### Summary of the Robert Morris Report

Shell engaged Robert Morris faculty members "to provide an independent
analysis[^14] of the economic impact of the construction and operation
of the contemplated petrochemical facility" by examining "direct
economic changes in job creation and overall economic output, focusing
on the construction and operational phases of the Project. Additionally,
the multiplicative impacts of the Project are considered"
[@clinton2021b, p. 7].

[^14]: The Robert Morris report is the result of independent work by its
    authors, not by Shell. Front matter in the report underscores not
    only the independence of the authors, but also the separation of the
    report from Shell: "All work contained in this study expresses only
    the opinion of the authors and is the result of publicly available
    information. The results and conclusions are those of the authors,
    not those of Royal Dutch Shell plc or any of its affiliates
    [@clinton2021c, p. iii]." The report does not rise to the level of a
    what Shell describes as "forward-looking statement" [@shelltab,
    "Cautionary Note"] about its plans and operations.

The analytics behind the report rely on input-output modeling, a
data-based, computational, and most often prospective approach to
unwinding the impact of projects, events, and changes in local
economies. An input-output model accounts for goods and services that
are required as inputs by industries to produce outputs of goods and
services necessary to satisfy requirements for supplies to other
industries or for delivery directly to consumers [@miernyk1965].

Impact estimates computed for the Robert Morris report relied
exclusively on IMPLAN software [@economic2019] for input-output modeling
to analyze "publicly available information" [@clinton2021d, p. iii].
IMPLAN is described as the "gold standard" for economic impact analysis.
An essay I authored [@passmore2022b] describes the technical details of
input-output modeling.

Although the regional economic impacts of building the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex probably are substantial, construction nearly is
complete as I write this blog posting. I, therefore, exclude
construction impacts and, instead, emphasize the portions of the Robert
Morris report focused on operating the Complex. I also exclude from my
summary portions of the report that estimate the statewide impacts of
the Complex. @clinton2021 indicated that "Most of the impact for the
proposed Project is expected to occur in Beaver County, Pennsylvania and
SWPA [southwestern Pennsylvania]" (p. 10).

After excluding construction and statewide impact from my consideration,
I extracted from the Robert Morris report and, then, recorded in Table 1
the potential economic impacts on Beaver County, on a 10-county
southwestern Pennsylvania area, and resulting from 40 years of Complex
activity. Pennsylvania counties comprised of Allegheny, Beaver,
Armstrong, Butler, Fayette, Green, Indiana, Lawrence, Westmoreland, and
Washington form the 10-county region. @clinton2021 constrained the
analysis to these 10 counties even though, "It is anticipated that
border counties in Ohio and West Virginia will be impacted" (p. 10).

Job numbers expected to be required during the operation of the complex
were the sole inputs into the IMPLAN software to initiate the estimates
in Table 1. Some assumptions stated in the report about job numbers:

> the Beaver County petrochemical facility will employ 600 fulltime
> people who will live and work in the region. We model the economic
> impact of this job creation on the Pennsylvania economy assuming that
> all workers who fill these jobs will reside in the Commonwealth. We
> also model the economic impact in SWPA assuming that 90% of the people
> who fill the new jobs reside in the region. Thus, 540 new jobholders
> will work and live in SWPA. Finally, we consider the impact of the new
> jobs on Beaver County. Based on comparative commuting patterns we
> assume that 40% to 75% of the people who fill the new jobs will live
> in Beaver County, generating 240 to 450 new jobs for people who reside
> there. [@clinton2021e, p. 13]

Also, the authors reported that, "We use the IMPLAN web application to
model the economic impact of these jobs on category number 157,
Petroleum Refinery operation" and note that "Because there is *no
current refinery operation in region* [emphasis mine], we created a
multiplier to estimate the SWPA and Beaver impacts based on state
results. [@clinton2021e, p. 13].

The relationships among components of economic impact reported
in Table 1 are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-emis). Definitions of
components of impact include:[^15]

[^15]: All definitions are provided in IMPLAN support documents
    [@implan-].

-   *Labor income* equals employee compensation plus proprietors'
    income.\
    -   *Employee compensation* is the sum of employee wages and
        salaries and supplements to wages and salaries. Wages and
        salaries are measured on an accrual, or "when earned" basis,
        which may be different from the measure of wages and salaries
        measured on a disbursement, or "when paid" basis. Supplements to
        wages and salaries include employer contributions for employee
        pension and insurance funds and of employer contributions for
        government social insurance.\
    -   *Proprietor's income* is current--production income (including
        income in--kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of
        tax--exempt cooperatives. Fees of corporate directors are
        included in income of proprietors, but the imputed net rental
        income of owner--occupants of all dwellings is included in
        rental income of persons. Proprietors' income excludes dividends
        and monetary interest received by nonfinancial businesses along
        with rental incomes received by persons not primarily engaged in
        the real estate business. These incomes are included in
        dividends, net interest, and rental income of persons,
        respectively.\
-   *Value added* is labor income plus taxes paid on production and
    imports and other property income.
    -   *Taxes paid on production and imports*, accounted as a negative
        value, include include sales and excise taxes, customs duties,
        property taxes, motor vehicle licenses, severance taxes, other
        taxes, and special assessments.\
    -   *Other property income* includes consumption of fixed capital,
        corporate profits, and net of business current transfer
        payments. It also includes income derived from dividends,
        royalties, corporate profits, and interest income.\
-   *Total output* is the sum of value added plus intermediate output.
    The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis defines intermediate output as
    "Goods and services that are used in the production process of other
    goods and services and are not sold in final-demand markets"
    [@glossary]. Intermediate Inputs are purchases of non-durable goods
    and services such as energy, materials, and purchased services that
    are used for the production of other goods and services, rather than
    for final consumption. Purchases of intermediate goods are
    business-to-business transactions.\
-   *Jobs* equal the number of part-- and full--time jobs, including all
    federal, state, and local government employment, military
    employment, and self--employment. This definition does not count
    "in--kind work" without pay by family member as employment.

*State and local earned income taxes* were not calculated by the IMPLAN
model, Instead, the authors of the Robert Morris report calculated tax
impacts *outside* the model using data *from* the model. The authors
explain:

> The project is expected to exert a substantial impact on state and
> local taxes. There will be a number of tax impacts such as income tax,
> property tax, and licenses and permits. The income tax is the most
> tractable. We assume a 3.07% state income tax rate for the
> Pennsylvania wage income and a 1% local rate. Given that labor income
> in the model includes both wages and benefits we assume that benefits
> are 34% of wages so that 75% of labor income would be taxed as wages
> and 25% would not be taxed because it relates to nontaxable benefits.

#### Issues

I identify and discuss four issues evident to me in the Robert Morris
report. These issues mostly evolve from technical matters that I believe
affect the validity of public beliefs that the report might have formed
about the regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex. But, first, I wish clearly attribute responsibility, not for
the matters with which I take issue in the report, but for failing to
exert due diligence the deciding expends taxes to support the operation
of the Complex.

To my mind, the responsibility for clarifying is not Shell's or the
authors of the Robert Morris report. Instead, I believe that public
representatives of the Commonwealth's citizens did not make their own
independent assessment of the regional economic impact of the Complex,
but uncritically adopted the economic impact estimates and forecasts
prepared for Shell and by other petrochemical industry associations to
make their decisions about tax expenditures for the Complex.

Shell did not pretend to support an economic impact report to meet the
public's needs for information. I can find nowhere in the report or in
Shell's public statements that the report is intended to thoroughly
inventory the costs and benefits of building and operating the Complex
for the public. Shell is, as it should be, focused on its own interests.
We should not conflate Shell's interests with the public interest. I do
not assert that cynically, but with full belief that firms like Shell
should pursue free-market self-interest above all.

I assess that the Robert Morris authors of the report handled well many
constraints imposed by assumptions for input-output modeling and
limitations levied by the regional data they analyzed. Many assumptions
and analysis decisions and compromises were required to use available
information to construct a statement of the regional economic benefits
of the Complex.

I do not know the terms of Shell's support for the Robert Morris report,
but I suppose that the Robert Morris authors produced a technical report
that satisfied Shell's interests. The authors do not assert that they
are serving the public's interest at any location in their report.

The report shows evidence a deft craftsmanship in conducting
input-output analysis with IMPLAN. The authors seem well-qualified in
education and experience to tackle this impact analysis. I base my
assessment on my approximately 45 years of experience with input-output
modeling and IMPLAN software, accumulating about 130 economic impact
studies completed.

The Robert Morris authors generated a report that probably reflected
Shell's supporting interests. They did their job. The report is not
designed primarily to serve the full interests of Commonwealth citizens.

But perhaps most telling about how the Robert Morris report and the
American Chemical Society's report were received is that the
Commonwealth did not feel the need to commission its own analysis of the
potential economic impact of the Complex. The Robert Morris report and
the American Chemical Society's seemed to satisfy public representatives
and officials that the public's interests were served by tax
expenditures on the Complex.

##### Specification of the Geography for Impact

The Robert Morris report focuses on impact in Beaver County as well as
in multiple Pennsylvania counties area near the Complex. I examine
information about travel to and from work in Beaver County that suggests
it is worthy to consider following data the Complex will distribute
economic impact over different geography.

##### Classification of the Industry Accounting for Impact

The Complex is classified in the "Petroleum Refineries" industry in the
Robert Morris report. I argue that, because the primary product of the
Complex is polyethylene pellets, output from the Complex probably is
best classified within the "Plastic Resins" industry. Differences in the
classification of the industry in which the Complex is classified are
important because data from a different industries likely would yield
different impact estimates.

##### Identification of Indirect Impact

Plastic resin production will directly support jobs at the Complex that
pay wages to workers and extract wage taxes for governments. Also, the
Complex will purchase goods and services from suppliers, who, in turn,
will indirectly multiply business value, income, jobs, and taxes beyond
the Complex. In addition, pay received by workers in the Complex and by
workers in the firms that supply the Complex will induce purchasing of
consumer goods and services.

Because the amount and kind of Shell's anticipated purchases of goods
and services are not known, the indirect economic impact of the Complex
is not clear. As a result, potential exists to over- or under-statement
of the full economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.
Also, if the primary product of the Complex is, as I assert, best
classified as plastic resin, not ethylene, then misspecification of the
full economic impact of the Complex shown the Robert Morris report is
possible.

##### Appropriateness of a Forty-Year Forecast of Impact

Forecasted in the Robert Morris report is the potential 40-year economic
impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.[^16] IMPLAN, the
developer of software applied to produce the Robert Morris report,
cautions against long-term forecasting due to various limitations of the
static input-output model programmed by IMPLAN in representing the
dynamics operating over time in the actual economy [@datateam2022, "Why
Isn't There Any Forecasting"].

[^16]: A 40-year span of life of the Complex might seem like a rather
    long period of plant service for which to estimate economic impact.
    @pearson2010 concluded that the average life of ethylene plants in
    North America and Europe will be around 30 years considering the
    anticipated effects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion,
    carburization-oxidation, and possible critical plant failure,
    although innovations could extend petrochemical and chemical plants
    well beyond their original anticipated design life. An important
    question is whether sustaining the Complex's product and resource
    markets is possible for as long as the infrastructure for the
    Complex is viable.

I conclude that these 40-year estimates of impact constitute an
extension of economic modeling and data beyond their limitations. The
economy of even a small region is constantly in flux. IMPLAN notes that

> "To make a projection of what the economy will look [requires
> prediction] of all the demands for consumption...and [to] know all the
> new commodities and technologies that will be available. Local
> availability of resources to meet that demand would also need to be
> known." [@datateam2022, "Why Isn't There Any Forecasting"]

Absolute and relative prices remain static in IMPLAN's equations,
although dynamic prices are in the nature of things -- especially when
considered over over 40-year forecast period. Also assumed in IMPLAN is
that the technology to produce an industry's output will not change, a
fanciful notion about the future of production processes. The 40-year
forecasts of economic impact displayed in the Robert Morris report were
prominent in public discussion of the Complex in the popular and
environmental press. The forecasts attempt to portray the sustainable
impact of the Complex. The economic model and data were not designed or
suitable for long-term economic forecasting.

#### Next Steps

Last, I describe briefly ways that remain for documenting the full
regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.
These ways do not include replicating the Robert Morris report after the
Complex starts operations. The Robert Morris report is filed. Shell's
ship already has sailed. Barring any significant impediments, the
Complex will open. And, for right or wrong, the Commonwealth has
codified its commitment to investment in the Complex through
legislation. Everything is moving forward.

Time to look forward to using extant data or obtaining new data to
attribute regional economic changes to the emerging activity of the
Complex. Also, although attempts were made to forecast the potential
regional economic impact of the Complex, efforts are necessary to
include measures of the social costs of the Complex in any future
assessment.

##### Follow the Data

Eric de Place, a research fellow at the Ohio River Valley Institute,
urged in a 2021 interview, "As the cracker facility opens, and as it
shifts to actually producing polyethylene, let's continue to look back
at the track record on the ground and compare it to the promises and see
whether economic growth happens or not" [@scott2021, para. 8]. This
assessment could be structured around regional economic data before and
after the start-up of the Complex and on a comparison with comparable
economic regions without an ethane cracker. A necessity will be to draw
on innovations in the creative and complex design of natural
experiments[^17] to make these comparisons valid and fair. As far as I
know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform such an assessment.

[^17]: Assessing the impact of the operation of the Complex is a complex
    technical problem in research design. Pre- and post-cracker
    comparisons of economic measures are possible. However, drawing
    causal connections between the ethane cracker intervention and pre-
    and post-operation states are complicated by the impossibility of
    random assignment of ethane cracker operations and the common
    threats to the validity of before-and-after studies. So-called
    "quasi-experimental" research designs [@shadish2001] are best-suited
    to control these design problems. For instance, interrupted
    time-series models [@shadish2001a, p. 175] of pre and post
    differences between the operation of the Complex are possible
    candidates for the Complex impact design. Propensity score
    adjustments [@austin2011] are possible for making "fair" comparisons
    of economic growth in the location of the Complex with similar
    communities absent a petrochemical operation. More on this research
    design problem in subsequent blog postings.

##### Weigh Costs, Especially of By-Products, as Well as Benefits

Any future assessment of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex's
economic impact should include *costs, not just benefits*. In
particular, such an assessment should calculate the cost exacted of
by-products from the Complex. Again, a by-product is a material produced
as a residual of, or incidental to, the production process. In an
accounting sense, by-products are associated with costs, not revenue.
The @environmentallawinstitute2018 and @doyle identified by-products of
the Complex that are considered hazardous by the World Health
Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and other agencies.

Recent reviews of research by @aguilar-gomez2022 highlighted the
substantial costs of pollution in terms of health, worker productivity,
crime, and decision-making from outdoor [@aguilar-gomez2022], indoor
[@duflo2008], and water [@schwarzenbach2010] sources even though
remarkable improvements in environmental quality have occurred in the
U.S. over several decades [@currie]. Nevertheless, low-income and
minority households often are concentrated in more highly polluted
regions and, consequently, suffer higher rates of age- and
cause-specific morbidity and mortality [@currie2020].

Some public statements about the Complex tend to separate the economic
impact of the Complex from concerns about the effects of its by-products
on public health as though the two realms of evidence are related only
by topic. The Complex often is discussed in fiscal terms. However,
significant by-products of the Complex often are addressed in the
language of epidemiology, medicine, and biostatistics. This separation
downgrades the perceived financial and economic consequences of
hazardous by-products, especially those by-products rarely seen or
smelled.[^18] Some synthesis of these approaches is desirable in future
assessments of the Complex. The concepts and tools of economic analysis
might present a path for this synthesis.

[^18]: David Foster Wallace in *This is Water* tells a little didactic
    parable about how the most obvious and important realities are often
    those that are hardest to see: "There are these two young fish
    swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the
    other way, who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys, how's the
    water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then
    eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, 'What the
    hell is water?' [@wallace2009a, pp. 3-4]."

##### Frame By-Products as Potential Negative Externalities

Identifying by-products as *externalities*, a term used in economics, is
a common way to account for their impact. An externality exists when
producing or consuming a good cause an impact on third parties not
directly involved in the production or consumption transaction.
Externalities are classified as either positive or negative. A negative
externality results in costs that are not paid by the producer or
consumer but rather by a third party.

The Complex could create negative externalities by making plastic resin
that, incidental to the process, could compromise the health of
third-party Pennsylvania citizens and damage the greater Pittsburgh
environment. One response to negative externalities is to charge fees
for production permits that are high enough to cover the expected
lifetime costs created by the externality. The Complex obtains permits
for the Commonwealth's Department of Environmental for specific amounts
and kinds of emissions or discharges. Unknown is whether these fees
cover the total costs of externalities.

Closely related to permit fees is the use of so-called "cap-and-trade"
government regulatory programs designed to limit, or cap, the total
level of emissions of certain chemicals, particularly carbon dioxide
[@howcap]. Firms that surpass the cap are taxed, while companies that
cut their emissions may sell or trade unused credits. In April 2022,
Pennsylvania entered the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a
controversial multistate cap-and-trade program to reduce CO~2~, but only
affecting electric power plants (see [25 PA. CODE CH.
145](https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/RGGI/2022/RGGIinPABulletin_4222022.pdf)).
Some criticisms of cap-and-trade programs involve assertions that, on
the one hand, the cap on emission usually is set too high and that, on
the other hand, the program eliminates jobs [@mcdevitt2020]. I am not
aware of any plans to integrate the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
into a cap-and-trade framework.

Another approach is to collect a "Pigouvian" tax[^19] that pays for the
consequences of the negative externality on independent third parties
and can dampen the manufacture of the good generating the externality by
raising the cost of its production. Pigouvian taxes shift the costs from
society back to the producers of these externalities. The aim, also, is
to eliminate market distortions of artificially low production costs
caused by passing some costs along to an innocent third party, the
public. Without a way of accounting for externalities associated with
the Complex, costs are "kicked down the road" to future generations of
Pennsylvanians. A familiar outcome, isn't it, in the history of many
Pennsylvania fossil fuel development and production?

[^19]: A Pigouvian tax takes its name from Arthur Pigou, the English
    economist who contributed to theory and understanding of
    externalities.

The amount of the Pigouvian tax should equal the cost of the harmful
externality, but calculating these costs is complex and nearly
impossible with any precision. I certainly realize, though, that the
total costs of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will prove
challenging to estimate. Even so, any estimate of the full economic
impact of the Complex should include public, social costs, especially
costs imposed from by-products.

Measuring the public, social costs of the Complex are prerequisites to,
even if difficult to measure, additional regulation and permitting, a
cap-and-trade approach, or establishing a Pigouvian tax to limit or
compensate for any externalities the Complex will generate.

### A Brief Sermon as a Postscript

I hope that this blog posting serves as a cautionary tale about review
of proposals for the use of public monies to subsidize innovation by
private enterprises. The case for public subsidies often rests solely on
the perception of the economic benefits of the innovation to the public.
But, proposals touting benefits only is merely a one-sided argument.
Seldom identified and analyzed are the total costs, risks, and
uncertainties that the public must bear when deciding to expend current
or potential tax revenue.

Consider how peculiar the request is to allocate public funds for
private innovation. Rarely are major financial decisions made by
businesses without balancing the benefits of innovation or change
against its costs. Similarly, the investment of public funds in private
innovation is a significant financial decision made by elected and
appointed public representatives. Yet, decisions to use public funds for
private innovation often do not undergo the same scrutiny invoked by
businesses.

Would a business make an investment decision without perpending costs as
well as benefits? Failure of a business to calculate a set of full pros
and cons of a financial proposition -- what Benjamin Franklin described
as calculating a moral or prudential algebra[^20] -- might result in
charges of financial malpractice. Shareholders of private enterprises
would take a dim view of willy-nilly investments based on benefits
without considering costs. So, why shouldn't the public demand a similar
benefit/cost calculus in any transaction made by a government that
expends scarce tax revenue gathered in trust from citizens? Where is the
due diligence for the Commonwealth's citizens if evidence solely about
benefits, absent costs, of public investment is pitched only by the
anticipated recipients of the funds?

[^20]: See a September 19, 1772 letter from Franklin to chemist Joseph
    Priestley [@franklin1817]. He advises Priestley to engage a moral or
    prudential algebra by listing the pros and cons of a decision and
    reflecting on the alternatives over time before deciding.

Businesses in market economies act to accomplish what is best for their
shareholders. Fiercely minimizing costs...profit by generating greater
revenue from operations than expenses...maximizing shareholder value.
Commonwealth citizens also have the right to expect that their
representatives follow their fiduciary duty to always act with the
public's best interests in mind. The Commonwealth manages tax
expenditures to profit the welfare of its citizens. Tax expenditures by
the Commonwealth should yield a stream of benefits for citizens that at
least equals expenditures. Without these motivations, neither businesses
nor governments are feasible and ultimately sustainable.

## My Point of View {.appendix}

I do not mean this blog posting to advocate or denounce, take a position
*pro* or *con* about, the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, although
my narrative in this posting carries a critical and evaluative tone.
Instead, I wrote this blog posting to document and clarify the meanings
I attached to the political (somewhat) and economic (more so) history,
status, and future of the Complex. Writing this blog posting was
essential to me because, as E. M. Forster, English fiction writer,
essayist, and librettist, reputedly once wrote, "How do I know what I
think until I see what I say?"

I certainly tried to keep you in mind, dear reader, as I composed this
blog posting. However, my primary motivation behind this posting was
selfishly on my own learning. If this blog posting had been written with
readers as my primary audience, it would have been tighter, contained
fewer asides, and eschewed deep and turgid cul-de-sacs of vocabulary and
argument. But I wrote it for myself. Therefore, I did not feel
constrained to reduce my word count, to "get to the point" quicker, or
to genuflect toward *de rigeur* authors and their arguments bullying us
as I might if I had been forced to write for an academic journal while
in a state of dread anticipating the pontificating, pointy, and deadly
attacks from a demonic "reviewer #2" [@guillet2020].

So, there you have it. Like Bill Belichick, New England Patriots head
coach and general manager, often tells reporters, "It is what it is." My
ride. I just picked you up as a hitcher.
