Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, a Shell subsidiary located in Houston,
Texas [@dunbradstreet], decided in 2016 after a long planning period to
invest in building and operating an ethane cracker to support
polyethylene resin manufacturing in southwestern Pennsylvania
[@shelltaa]. The 386-acre Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex (Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crackerM)) is adjacent to the Ohio River in Potter and
Center townships near the borough of Monaca in Beaver County,
Pennsylvania [@pennsylv, "Project development"]. Polyethylene is a
feedstock for manufacturing plastic products, especially packaging and
auto components. Polyethylene is produced from ethylene created from
steam processing of ethane, a natural gas liquid found in some gas
streams in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations.

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/ethane_cracker.jpeg")
```

Shell has confirmed that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will
commence operations in 2022 [@shrum2022]. In December 2021, a Shell
Chemical Appalachia executive was reported to have said that "Much of
the work is done....Now we are tying the various larger structures
together" [@suttles2020]. One estimate places the cost of the Complex at
\$10 billion [@schneider2019].

Why Pennsylvania? And, why Beaver County? "The basic answer is very
simple," said Ate Visser at a 2016 industry conference in Pittsburgh. At
the time, Visser was an executive with Shell Chemical Appalachia. Visser
said "You're sitting here on a world-class resource base at the doorstep
of your customer [@cocklin2016]." Leaders of oil and gas industry
associations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia noted that "Our
three states produce roughly one-third of America's natural gas, making
Appalachia the third largest gas producer in the world -- behind only
the U.S. itself and Russia" [@callahan2022]. More than 70% of North
American polyethylene market exists within a 700-mile radius of the
Complex [@pennsylvc, "Project development"].

@gist2016 wrote that "The Shell cracker represents one of the
biggest-ever industrial investments in the tristate region
(Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), whose industrial sector
suffered a series of set-backs through the second half of the 20th
century (para. 4)." @whitfield2018 described a study [@reporta2017][^1]
for the Team Pennsylvania Foundation [@teampa] that predicted
"significant new investments in energy infrastructure such as gas
gathering lines, pipelines, storage facilities, and fractionation plants
(para. 3).

[^1]: "The full report has never been released to the public," wrote
    @sanzillo2020a (p. 3). Although the report has been cited widely by
    government, corporate, business associations and media, only the
    executive summary has been publicly released. The authors of the
    report confirmed that their report was withheld "on the grounds that
    it only released the full study to entities with a commercial
    interest" [@sanzillo2020b, p. 3].

Shell stuck with its decision to invest in the Complex, even though many
Shell projects worldwide were delayed, resized or canceled altogether
due to a downturn in the oil and gas markets as the Complex project
commenced [@davis2016].

## In This Blog Posting....

In the remainder of this posting I review risk, uncertainty, and gaps in
information that could influence the perceptions of the economic impact
of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. The flow of this blog
posting follows three threads:[^2]

[^2]: Read my manifesto, *My Point of View*, in an appendix to this
    posting for a brief statement of my motivations and approach to
    writing about the economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical
    Complex.

-   I, first, delineate some of the questions that remain for me about
    the markets affecting the Complex, the worthiness of public
    expenditures on the Complex, and the regional economic effects that
    the public expects from the operation of the Complex. I highlight
    the importance of evidence about expected economic impact to promote
    public acceptance of the Complex and to stimulate the need for
    public expenditures to support the Complex.\
-   Next, I outline my simple understanding of the steps in the
    operation of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Understanding
    the nature and structure of inputs, processes, and outputs shapes
    expectations for the regional economic impact of the Complex.\
-   And, last, I critically examine a report by professors associated
    with Robert Morris University that was prepared for Shell Chemical
    Appalachia LLC. This report, *Updated Economic Impact Analysis:
    Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania*
    [@clinton2021a], was produced before the Complex was commissioned.
    Many readers of the Robert Morris report might view information
    presented as persuasive evidence that responds to the public's
    questions about the potential impact of the Complex on the regional
    economy.[^3]

[^3]: The public record about each of these three threads is thin.
    Information about the markets for products expected from the
    Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex often sits behind paywalls.
    Little is known about negotiations between Shell and Commonwealth
    officials for public support of the Complex, except for snippets of
    revelations made in public comments documented in the popular press.
    Potential regional economic impacts of the Complex were asserted
    through industry-sponsored reports, which were echoed seemingly
    uncritically by Commonwealth officials. There seems to have been a
    sparse independent response to these reports. My understanding of
    the operations of the Complex was informed to some extent by public
    Internet-accessible documents about ethane cracking and
    polymerization, but primarily from a single application Shell
    submitted for air quality approval. For the most part, however,
    important details are unknown to me about the workings of the
    Complex that dictate its supply chain and affect its outputs of
    products, co-product, and by-products. My discussion of the
    Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in this blog posting resulted
    from looking at shadows on the wall rather than direct, first-person
    observation of events, transactions, and decisions made by Shell and
    Commonwealth officials. I dealt with what was available to me.

## Questions Remain About the <br> Viability of the Complex

### Can Product and Resource Markets Sustain the Complex?

Risk, uncertainty, and volatility plague markets for fossil fuels and
products derived from these fuels. In September 2020, @moodys2020 raised
questions about the credit-worthiness of new fossil fuel projects.
Markets, regulations, and environmental concerns affecting quality of
human life are influencing the viability of the business proposition for
added fossil fuel capacity.

According to a biting 2020 opinion offered by @sanzillo2020 for the
[Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis](https://ieefa.org/),[^4] the Pennsylvania Petrochemical
Complex faces prospects of low product prices, price and supply
volatility in ethane feedstock markets, risk of oversupply of
polyethylene resins that the Complex will manufacture, stiff competition
from other producers, competition from the supply of recycled plastics
materials, and the influence of possible low general economic growth
(Figure \@ref(fig:img-price) is a plot of recent natural gas price
volatility). Concluded by the Institute was that the Complex "will open
to market conditions that are more challenging than when the project was
planned. The [C]omplex is likely to be less profitable than expected and
face an extended period of financial distress (@sanzillo2020, p.1; see,
also, @bruggers2020 and @deplace2022)."

    energy economy.

```

### Tax Expenditures by Pennsylvania Citizens Are Large...But Prudent?

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allocated funds to support preparation
of the site for the Complex in Monaca. In addition, the Commonwealth
offered tax and financial incentives to site the Complex in
Pennsylvania. Use of the term, "incentives," however, makes the
Commonwealth's decision sound distant from its financial accounting.
Make no mistake, though. These incentives plainly are *tax
expenditures*, defined in an accounting sense by the U.S. Treasury
[@taxexpe; see, also, @hellerstein1966, p. 793] as

> revenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which
> allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income
> or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a
> deferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as
> alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or
> regulatory programs. (para. 1)

As a consequence of excluding taxes and offering tax credits for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, citizens of the Commonwealth forego
the opportunity to collect general fund revenue. Also, reduction of
revenue from these expenditures and credits could require the
Commonwealth to raise taxes to remain revenue-neutral [@sammartino2020,
p. 4]. In 2019, Stacker, a news organization, calculated that the tax
breaks allocated to the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex ranked 13th
in dollar value out of 50 national projects receiving corporate
subsidies from governments over a 20-year period [@crisafulli].

If projects were judged on costs alone, few investments would be made,
of course. Rather, citizens must weigh the costs of this public
investment in this private venture against the benefits distributed to
the regional economy that could accrue from the operation of the
Complex. As I will assert in more detail subsequently in this blog
posting, I do not believe that these benefits were demonstrated well
before operation of the Complex.

#### Expenditures for Site Preparation

Funds from *Act 2 of 1995* [@landrec] -- which supports remediation of
tracts of land that were developed for industrial purposes, polluted,
and then abandoned (*aka* "brownfields") -- funded a portion of costs of
preparation of the site, which was the location of a former zinc
smelter. Remediation involved covering the site with clean fill,
installing a synthetic cap over previous disposal areas on the property,
and collecting and treating potentially contaminated storm water before
discharge [@shellpe]. Ate Visser speaking for Shell at a 2016 industry
conference in Pittsburgh said that construction of the Complex would
been impossible without Act 2 funds [@cocklin2016b, ¶7].

Commonwealth expenditures did not alone fund site preparation. Shell
incurred significant expenses. For example, Shell committed \$80 million
on top of Act 2 funds to clean up environmental contamination at the
site and prepare the land for construction of the Complex
[@cocklin2016b, ¶6]. A PennDOT spokesman, said Shell paid for a \$60
million project to alter a Commonwealth roadway, Pennsylvania Route 18,
and make other road fixes at the site [@bumsted2016]. Also, Shell paid
nearly \$70 million to move Center Township's water intake site and
build Township a new water treatment plant. The water intake was located
where Shell built docking facilities for delivery of equipment during
the construction phase of the Complex [@cocklin2016c, ¶4].

#### Tax Expenditures Offered as Incentives to Site in Pennsylvania

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania used tax expenditures as incentives for
siting petrochemical plants such as the Complex in Pennsylvania:

-   *Act 16 in 2012* [@keystone] makes petrochemical manufacturers like
    Shell exempt from all corporate net income taxes and property taxes
    for 15 years after first occupying the Beaver County site, as long
    as it invests at least one billion dollars (not necessarily in
    Pennsylvania) and creates at least 400 new permanent full-time jobs.
    Shell said it would deploy 600 jobs to operate the Complex
    [@pennsylv, "Environment and society"].\
-   *Act 85 in 2012* [@taxrefo, "Article XVII-G"] gives Shell a tax
    credit of 5 cents for every gallon of ethane it buys to manufacture
    ethylene, provided that 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs are created
    during construction of the Complex (≅6,000 were, according to Shell
    [@shellst]). Shell will pay no taxes as stipulated in Act 16, but
    Shell can benefit by selling unused credits as tax equity for other
    purchasing firms to reduce their own tax liability.

```{r img-acts, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*Pennsylvania Act 16 and Act 85.* <br> (Images captured from www.legis.state.pa.us website <br> and edited by David Passmore)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/actsofcorbett.jpg")
```

Thomas Corbett, Pennsylvania Governor at the time, initially sought an
annual \$66 million tax credit for 25 years, a total of \$1.65 billion.
If the Complex sustains between 400 to 600 jobs annually for 25 years, a
rough, undiscounted calculation[^5] indicates a cost per job, a
recognized economic development metric (@sahota and
@ukhomescommunitiesagency2015),[^6] over the 25-year period between
\$2.75 million and \$13 million, which equals \$165,000 to \$112,000 per
job per year. A dollar figure capping expenditures was not placed in the
final draft of legislation, meaning that the credits are unlimited and
flexible [@bumsted2012]. Shell's Visser said "I can tell you, with hand
to my heart, that without these incentives, we would not have made this
investment decision [@cocklin2016a, ¶6]." Governor Corbett, who steered
these expenditures through legislation, said that "When you're looking
at the investment you have to look at what it would have cost us had we
done nothing, had we let these businesses go" [@detrow2012].

[^5]: And, my own calculation. So quite unofficial.

[^6]: Although writers for the World Bank have indicated that "cost per
    job may not be the right indicator in measuring job creation
    policies, but rather the social rate of return associated with the
    intervention" [@rabalino2018].

#### Are Tax Expenditures Effective as Incentives?

The extant research literature examining the relationship between
offering tax incentives and consequent economic growth is complex,
varied, and inconclusive [@buss2001a, pp. 94-100]. In particular,
evidence is weak that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader
economic growth at the state and local levels [@slattery2020].
@bartik2020 reported that so-called "place-based" policies cost around
\$60 billion annually (in 2019 dollars) and that the typical state and
local incentive offer, as a percent of the value-added of the business
receiving an incentive, tripled in size between in the 30 years
preceding 2019.

The body of research is thin about the economic growth that resulted
from using state and local expenditures of tax revenue to subsidize
private firms, State governments prefer not to conduct rigorous
evaluations the costs and benefits of tax expenditures used to incent
site location [@buss2001]. An open question is whether Shell might have
decided to relocate to the West Virginia. Ohio, and Pennsylvania region,
if not Beaver County, even without incentives, especially if the region
offers unique and desirable business opportunities. According to
@bartik2018, in 9 out 10 cases, firms receive a tax incentive for a
location decision that they would have made anyway, even if no incentive
had been provided (p. 40 and note 60 on p. 127). Also, an important
consideration is whether a location of the Complex in Ohio or West
Virginia, rather than Pennsylvania, would have been less beneficial for
Pennsylvania residents in the region. As far as I know, the Commonwealth
has not embarked on an assessment of the effectiveness of Act 16 and Act
85 expenditures on economic growth in the Commonwealth. The net public
benefit of tax expenditures made on the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex remains to be demonstrated.

@foodandwaterwatch2020 cataloged the long history of failed tax
incentives in Pennsylvania, including luring Volkswagen to Westmoreland
County and the European shipbuilder Kvaerner to the Philadelphia
shipyard, enticing the Vanguard Group to keep its corporate offices from
moving out of state, and offering state and city grants for a Comcast
building in Philadelphia (p. 4). Even so, Pennsylvania Governor Corbett
enthusiastically compared his announcement of the tax expenditure deal
with the petrochemical industry to "what it must have been like when the
first steel mill was built in Pittsburgh, starting an industry that had
never been here before" [@murphy2016a]. "I think it's important not only
for the young generation but generations yet to be born," Corbett said.
"It's going to establish an industry here in western Pennsylvania that I
think has the potential to grow to considerable size."

### What Are Stakeholders' Perspectives of the Complex?

#### Shell's Stake, Different Than the Public's

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex sums to a massive long-term
investment of money, time, effort, and planning by Shell. Shell
undoubtedly foresees a financial return from investing in the Complex,
even though the Complex will face the vagaries of resource and product
markets and emerging regulation, as will any forward-looking decision in
the energy sector. Shell makes decisions as a private enterprise with
shared ownership among stockholders. As such Shell properly must invoke
the criterion of "what's in it for us and, ultimately, our shareholders"
in its decisions.

Deep inside the company's spreadsheets, Shell must have weighed on a
finely-tuned scale the current and future costs, risks, uncertainties,
revenue, and profits in the balance of its worldwide business efforts to
yield the momentous decision to move forward with the Complex.
Proceeding to build and operate the Complex was a complex, bold, and
courageous business decision made by one of the largest independent
energy firms in the world. Much is at stake for Shell.

Shell's success also could translate to a positive impact on the
regional economy in proportion that the inputs purchased for the
Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex originate in the region and its
outputs are sold and used subsequently for manufacturing in the region.
Such an impact on the regional economy is, however, incidental and is
not essential for Shell's financial success with the Complex. Obtaining
a return from the Commonwealth's tax expenditures is essential for
Pennsylvania citizens, though. The Commonwealth's tax expenditures
reduce Shell's costs in exchange for modest job and investment
possibilities derived in the short term by construction and in the long
term by operation of the Complex.

#### The Public's Interest, Different Than Shell's

Through the Commonwealth's expenditures of tax revenues, Pennsylvania
citizens have become significant financial stakeholders in the Complex.
Yet, measures of success expected from the Complex by Pennsylvania
citizens are not the same as Shell's. Citizens seek regional economic
impact from their investments in the form of jobs and income for
citizens and tax revenue for governments to fund public goods and
services. Commonwealth and local tax collection from Shell were foregone
by state legislation, however.

These expenditures of tax revenues for Shell and other energy companies
came at the same time as reduced Pennsylvania spending for county-level
public health programs and other public services and an across-the-board
\$1 billion cut in state spending [@detrow2012a, para. 2]**.** In
addition, negotiations about these expenditures remained hidden from
public view due to confidentiality agreements with Shell
[@phillips2012]. Governor Thomas Corbett,

> "Pushed back against the argument the tax break is a corporate
> giveaway, saying, 'They think we're giving money to them. No we're
> not. What we're saying is, you build it. You provide all these jobs
> for all these people. And we'll take a little less money from you, so
> we have more money for us.' " [@detrow2012e]

Any enterprise engaging in business transactions -- even an enterprise
so primitive as a child's lemonade stand -- generates an economic
impact. So, there is no doubt that the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
Complex will have some impact on the regional economy. But, in what way?
By how much? Will the benefits of regional economic impact cover the
costs of expenditures of revenue collected from Pennsylvania citizens?
*Cui bono?* Answers to these critical questions about the public
benefits of the Complex might help justify expenditures on the Complex
by Pennsylvania citizens.

#### Assertions of Potential Regional Impact Were <br> Influential in Opinions About the Complex

Without a doubt, several reports from the American Chemistry Council, a
trade association,[^7] framed the potential benefits of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex for Pennsylvania citizens, their elected
legislators, and public officials. In 2011, the Council reported
[@americanchemistrycouncil2011, p. 1] that a 25% increase in ethane
supply on growth in the petrochemical sector would generate 17,000 new
knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs in the U.S. chemical industry and
395,000 additional jobs outside the chemical industry. Also concluded
was that this investment would generate \$4.4 billion more in federal,
state, and local tax revenue,annually (\$43.9 billion over 10 years).

[^7]: The American Chemistry Council defines itself as "America's oldest
    trade association of its kind, representing more than 190 companies
    engaged in the business of chemistry -- an innovative, economic
    growth engine that is helping to solve the biggest challenges facing
    our country and the world. Our members are the leading companies
    engaged in all aspects of the business of chemistry, from the
    largest corporations to the smallest, and everything in between"
    [@aboutac].

In 2012, the American Chemistry Council issued an addendum to their
national report that focused on the economic impact of natural gas
development in Pennsylvania. The Council asserted that an additional
\$4.8 billion in chemical industry activity would generate over 2,400
high-paying, desirable jobs in the Pennsylvania chemical industry
[@americanchemistrycouncil2012, para. 4]. In addition, new petrochemical
production in Pennsylvania would generate purchases of raw materials,
services, and other purchases throughout the supply chain, producing]
more than 8,200 indirect jobs, generate 7,000 payroll-induced jobs in
the state. A one-time \$3.2 billion investment in a Pennsylvania
petrochemical complex would result in more than \$900 million in
spending inside the state of Pennsylvania
[@americanchemistrycouncil2012b, para. 6] 

The Council also indicated that construction of a petrochemical
facility, purchase of new equipment for the facility, and operation of
the facility would result in federal and state tax revenues of \$363
million and local tax revenues of \$141 million
[@americanchemistrycouncil2012c, Table 3 and Table 4].

These reports were influential at the front edge of the advancing
natural gas revolution, the "pivot of world's energy future"
[@kolb2014], in Pennsylvania and other states in the northeast of the
United States. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not produce its own
independent study of the potential economic impact of ethane cracking
and plastic resin production in Pennsylvania [@detrow2012b] -- nor did
it finish a study that it started in time to affect legislation of tax
expenditures [@detrow2012c, para. 10]. Pennsylvania Governor Thomas
Corbett said that he trusted the American Chemistry Council's estimates
of potential economic impact [@detrow2012d].

The American Chemical Society's reports about the potential economic
impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex were the linchpins in
the appeal that secured allocation of tax expenditures through Act 16
and Act 85 to support the construction and operation of the Complex.
However, questions still remain about the validity of the American
Chemical Society estimates of the potential economic impact of the
Complex and, therefore, whether the reports demonstrated the potential
benefits from Pennsylvania citizens' investment in the Complex.

*Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver
County, Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021], a report written by professors
associated with Robert Morris University for Shell Chemical Appalachia
LLC was released in 2021. For many readers, this report provided
evidence to satisfy questions raised about the expected impact of the
Complex on the regional economy before the Complex is commissioned in
2022.

I believe that the report produced by Robert Morris University
researchers did not reduce uncertainty that remained about the wisdom of
tax expenditures on the Complex. In fact, I assert that conceptual and
methodological questions about this report from Robert Morris -- and
reflecting backward on the American Chemistry Council reports conducted
similarly -- negate justification for public expenditures to support the
construction and operation of the Complex. I do *not* deny that regional
economic benefits will flow from the Complex, just that the reports were
inadequate to uphold decisions made to allocate public expenditure for
the Complex.

#### Leaders in the Commonwealth and Beyond Were Enthralled

Studies released about the potential economic impact of the Complex must
have left a strong impression on the representatives of Pennsylvania
citizens and other leaders. Public officials -- high and low and across
the spectrum of politics -- stood firmly behind the promise and in the
bright light of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.

In 2019, President Trump visiting during construction of the Complex
remarked that "These folks are from Shell, and this is a plant like no
other. It's just incredible....And we appreciate the investment, and
we're going to do everything possible to make [inaudible -- perhaps, *it
successful? It successful?*] [@remarks2019]." Governor Tom Corbett
summarized that "The benefits to the state's southwest and to all of
Pennsylvania are immense" [@gibson2012, ¶9]. Corbett felt that public
investment in the Complex would leave a legacy of benefits for
Pennsylvanians. He said, "What this does --- it talks about whoever is
governor after me, two or five governors after me, having an economy
that is growing based on manufacturing that does not exist right now. So
they will have money for education, for social services" [@detrow2012,
¶19].

```{r img-trump, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,   fig.cap='*Former President Trump Visits Site of Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, August 2019* <br> (Image from https://tinyurl.com/trumpvisit)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/trumpvisit.png")
```

General bipartisan praise for the Complex mirrored the enthusiasm of
Trump and Corbett. For instance, State Senator Mike Kelly, a Democrat,
welcomed the decision and praised Governor Corbett saying, "Today's
announcement by Shell is a great day for all Pennsylvanians....I
especially want to commend Governor Tom Corbett and his economic team
for their efforts in securing this economic development project for
Pennsylvania. Kudos to all who worked to bring this home and make it
happen" [@gibson2012, ¶ 16 and para. 21].

State Senator Jay Costa, also a Democrat, applauded "the governor's and
the community's efforts to land such a valuable enterprise and bring
home the benefits this plant will provide for generations to come"
[@gibson2012b, ¶21]. Marcellus Shale Coalition President Kathyrn Klaber
noted that Shell's decision to invest in the Complex was "further
indication of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Governor Corbett's
continued work to responsibly develop the Marcellus and expand
broad-based economic benefits for all" [@gibson2012a, ¶6].

I defer to a subsequent major section of this blog posting my criticisms
of the recent report from Robert Morris University, criticisms that I
believe apply similarly to the almost decade-old American Chemical
Society reports. Necessarily prior, though, to motivate my criticisms is
a common understanding the inputs, processes, and outputs form the
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. So,next, I offer my bare bones
description of the operation of the Complex and refer to information in
this description in my subsequent review the Robert Morris report.

## Operation of the Pennsylvania <br> Petrochemicals Complex

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca will house seven
ethane cracker units,[^8] two high density polyethylene and one low
density polyethylene resin manufacturing units (potential of 1,600,000
metric tons of polyethylene annually), natural gas-fired combustion
turbines co-producing steam and electricity, four emergency diesel
generators, diesel-powered pumps, cooling towers, multiple fuel and
storage tanks, multiple flaring units, an incinerator, air pollution
control devices, and a wastewater treatment facility
[@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014; @stateofpennsylvania2016, pp.
5-7].[^9]

[^8]: Six in operation, while a seventh undergoes maintenance.

[^9]: Some of the information I present about the operation of the
    Complex is due to general, publicly-available descriptions of ethane
    cracking and polymerization. However, for specific information about
    the Complex I relied on Shell's air quality approval\
    application to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014a], which I treated as
    authoritative, Shell-vetted and -sanctioned details about the
    Complex.

Displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) are inputs, processes, and
outputs of the Complex. For simplicity of presentation, the flow of
activity portrayed in Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF) skims over many of
the details of the ethane-to-ethylene-to-plastic resin process. I
narrate some of the details about inputs, processes, and outputs that
flow from top to bottom of Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF).

```

### Inputs

The Complex can produce 1.5 million metric tons of ethane annually by
cracking ethane molecules to make ethylene
[@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014, p. 1-2].[^10] All of the ethane
required is delivered to the Complex by the Falcon Ethane Pipeline
System, a 97-mile pipeline network incoming to the Complex from Houston,
Pennsylvania, and Cadiz and Scio in Ohio. (see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-falcon)). Ethane transported by Falcon is unique --- it's
the only energy commodity that can morph from being sold as natural gas
or alternatively as a liquid feedstock for petrochemical plants, an
attribute that contributes to ethane's volatility of production volume
and price. [@braziel2022]. As with many aspects of the construction and
operation of the Complex, the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System has
generated considerable controversy [see, e.g., @realtal2022].

[^10]: The document, *Air Quality Plan Approval Application:
    Petrochemicals Complex, Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC, Beaver
    County, Pennsylvania* [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014], is the
    best source of information I have found about the processes applied
    and emissions of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Therefore
    I cite this application frequently in this blog posting. The
    application is Shell's official description of the Complex offered
    to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The
    Department issued a permit in 2015
    [@commonwealthofpennsylvania2015], which was valid through 2019. I
    am not aware of a renewal of this permit and any process or emission
    updates that a renewal application might cite.

Providing input to these three nodes in the pipeline network are gas
processing plants that separate liquids and remove solids or other
particulate matter in the gas stream lifted from regional wells drawing
from Marcellus and Utica shale formations. The three modes are
tactically located proximal to clusters of wells producing "wet" gas.
Some wells not only produce natural gas as methane, but also include
natural gas liquids such as ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane.
These products constitute as liquids by, depending on the gas pressure,
condensing to become the "wet," portion of the natural gas [@hey2017].
In general, Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Ohio, southwestern
Pennsylvania, and West Virginia involve wet gas (See Figure
\@ref(fig:img-wet) for locations).

```{r img-wet, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2, out.extra="class=external", out.width='90%' ,fig.cap='*Locations of Wet and Dry Gas in Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations.* <br> (Map from https://bit.ly/wet-dry-gas)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/wetdry.jpg")
```

Natural-gas-fired cogeneration turbines will produce steam for the
ethane cracker and will generate electricity for the Complex. Excess
electricity generated through cogeneration will be sold for distribution
in daily energy markets run by the PJM Interconnection electrical power
grid serving selected northeastern U.S. states
[@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014, p. 1-2]. As much as one-third of
the electricity output of the cogeneration units might become available
for regional distribution [@newshel].

Superheated pressurized steam in the cracker dilutes and vaporizes
ethane. Heat from the steam splits the bonds between carbon and hydrogen
atoms in ethane, a process called "pyrolysis," to yield ethylene (more
detail in @passmore2022a, para, 5).

*Oil & Gas Journal* [@brelsford2021] reported that the Complex also will
draw 20 million gallons of water every day from the Ohio River. Some
water not used to generate steam is used to cool the effluent produced
by the cracker or to contribute to other processes at the Complex. Water
is reused or returned to the river as a by-product after treatment to
meet water quality standards. A by-product is a material produced as a
residual of, or incidental to, the production process. In an accounting
sense, by-products are associated with costs.

Unknown are the amounts and kinds of other inputs to the Complex beyond
ethane, natural gas, and water, although these other inputs could add to
the costs of business of the Complex and affect the supply chain for the
complex in similarly unknown ways.

### Processes

At the core of the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex are ethane
crackers that generate ethylene for making polymer resin that, in turn,
is extruded as small pellets.

#### Cracking

An ethane cracker is a furnace into which ethane is fed. The ethane is
diluted with with steam that is heated to approximately 1300° F. The
heat of the furnace cracks ethylene from ethane molecules, freeing two
molecules of hydrogen in the process and creating a double bond[^11]
between carbon atoms (structures modeled in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). The hot gas mixture exhausted from the cracker is
cooled, or "quenched [@quenchw]," with water to prevent further chemical
reactions. Water and heat are recovered for recycling back into the
cracking process, although some water is treated and discharged as a
by-product of the Complex [@partlow2022].

[^11]: A a type of chemical bond in which two electron pairs are shared
    between two atoms [@helmenstinea].

```{r img-crack, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external",  fig.cap='*Comparison of the Chemical Structures of Ethane and Ethylene.* <br> (Image from https://insights.globalspec.com/images/assets/490/1490/LNG-04a.jpg)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/LNG-04a.jpeg")
```

Ethylene and other substances exhausting in a gaseous state from the
cracker are compressed to a liquid state and, then, refrigerated.
Fractional distillation further separates ethylene from the cooled,
quenched mixture by taking advantage of differences in the vaporization
point of ethylene compared with other chemical components of the mixture
[@helmenstine].

Various gases that are by-products of cracking are burned off into the
air in a controlled combustion process called "flaring" [@flaring],
which releases carbon dioxide into the air as a by-product. Wastewater
not reused in the cracking process but containing by-products from the
cracker is collected, treated, and discharged. Then, the ethylene
produced is stored for manufacturing plastic resins.

An important point of information is that ethylene cracked from ethane
is not reported by Shell as a product of the Complex that is meant to be
sold to customers. Its sole use is for creating plastic resin.
Liquification of ethylene not used in polyethylene production is
possible, but not indicated for the Complex.[^12] I have not found any
indication that Shell will produce ethylene as a co-product of the
Complex.

[^12]: I uncovered only a graphic described as a "generalized graphic"
    that indicated that liquefied ethylene is a possible co-product for
    export from an ethane cracker [@petroche]. Although the graphic does
    not seem to have been designed to describe the Pennsylvania
    Petrochemical Complex in particular, it was re-purposed and applied
    to indicate the probable plant/process layout of the Complex.
    Shell's *Air Quality Plan Approval Application*
    [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014] does not identify liquefied
    ethylene as a product of the Complex.

Shell indicated that some co-products, such as "Solid components
(coke/pitch/tar) are removed...and sent offsite for either use or
disposal [and]....tar and light gasoline [are}...shipped offsite for
further processing into products" [@rtpenvironmentalassociatesinc.2014,
p. 3-4], although the volume and possible commercial value of these
co-products are not reported. Co-products are goods or services produced
incidental to main production that have market value to generate
revenue. In contrast, a by-product typically is a material that is a
consequence of production that is associated with costs.

Ethylene produced at the Complex is the primary input to polyethylene
manufacturing, the next and final stage of production in the Complex.
Ethane cracking gathers more attention than polymerization probably
because the ethane cracker forms a large footprint at the Complex and
consumes most inputs of ethane, water, electricity, and steam to the
Complex. The final product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
sold to customers is, in fact, pelletized polyethylene resin, not
ethylene. *The nature of the final product manufactured at the Complex
has important consequences for the validity of estimates made of
economic impact of the Complex.* More to that point subsequently in this
blog posting.

#### Polymerization

Unique among elements is the capability of carbon to form single
chemical bonds with up to four other atoms and to double or triple bond
with itself, as in a double-bond ethylene molecule (again, see Figure
\@ref(fig:img-crack)). Carbon is one of the only elements, because of
its bonding properties, that can create long chain-shaped molecules to
form the basis for the fats, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
and proteins that serve as the basis of life itself. Chaining together
ethylene molecules (monomers) through a chemical process called
*polymerization* produces polyethylene (a polymer, which means "many
parts").

Polyethylene production is initiated by a catalyst suspended with
ethylene molecules under pressure. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds
up chemical reactions, but is not consumed during the reaction. The
catalyst bonds ethylene monomers into a long chain forming a polymer
(see Figure \@ref(fig:img-polymer) showing monomer and an n-length
polymer). The polymerization process releases high amounts of heat.[^13]
As a consequence, continuous cooling is required to prevent runaway
chemical reactions [@burdett2018, p. 67] that could ruin the product or
manufacturing equipment.

[^13]: More technically, is an *exothermic reaction*.

Ethylene passes to two gas phase polyethylene units and one slurry
technology uni to manufacture low-density polyethylene and high-density
polyethylene. Processes in both units employ catalysts, but use
different equipment and operating parameters to produce each specific
grade of polyethylene. After inclusion of additives and further
conditioning, the polymer is extruded to form pellets, the primary
product of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.

```

### Outputs

Plastic resin in pellet form is the product of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex that has market value for Shell. At the same
time, the Complex accumulates by-products of its industrial processes
have consequence for the public health and environmental quality.

#### Polyethylene Resin Pellets

Polyethylene has many desirable attributes for manufacturing. In
general, @kaiser2021 noted that polyethylene can handle large loads
without fracture and is flexible and stretchable. Polyethylene is light
and versatile and absorbs no water. Low-density polyethylene resists
many types of chemical reactions and impact, while allowing relatively
easy fabrication and forming. High-density polyethylene is known for its
outstanding tensile strength, large strength-to-density ratio,
high-impact resistance and high melting point.

Polyethylene is a good electrical insulator and can be produced to be
transparent. Polyethylene has thermoplastic properties useful in
production -- i.e., it softens or fuses when heated and hardens and
becomes rigid again when cooled. The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
will produce high density and low density polyethylene (see,
respectively, @whatis and @lowdens).

Nearly all polyethylene is sold after initial manufacturing as small
(≅5mm), white, lentil-shaped pellets (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-nurd)),
although round, flat, square, cylindrical, and various other shapes of
many colors are manufactured. The pellets are known as "nurdles."
Nurdles are bagged and stored before distribution by rail or truck to
warehouses or directly to customers. The added cost of pelletizing
polyethylene is considerable [@burdett2018b, p. 67], but nurdles are
relatively easy to ship. Customers who buy pellets are not households,
but are other businesses which use the nurdles in their own production
involving, for example, injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding.

```{r img-nurd, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina = 2,  out.extra="class=external",  fig.cap='*White Nurdles.* <br> (Photo from gentlemanrook - originally posted to Flickr as Plastic Pellets - &quot;Nurdles&quot;, <br> CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4487785)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/nurdles.png")
```

Plastic resin pellets are unit-priced by the pound for sale in
downstream markets. Pellet prices are volatile [@pederson2021] because
they are driven on the supply side by equally volatile prices for
natural gas and on the demand side by two major factors. First,
consumers express preferences for "eco-friendly" packaging solutions.
Second, environmental regulation of plastic products is increasing. Some
observers believe nurdles are one of the most destructive toxic wastes
released in the environment (see discussion by @mcveigh).

#### By-Products

Many industrial processes create co-products and by-products.[^14] The
Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will generate electricity and,
perhaps, some output of cracking as co-products. However, the Complex
will create by-products, the cost of which Shell will bear, in part, by
paying for permits to discharge substances into the environment. Other
costs of by-products will be borne separately by Pennsylvania citizens
or jointly with Shell.

[^14]: Again, co-products are goods or services produced incidental to
    main production that have market value to generate revenue. A
    by-product is a material produced as a residual of, or incidental
    to, the production process. In an accounting sense, by-products are
    associated with costs.

Cracking ethane emits by-products that can render the air, soil, water,
or other natural resources harmful or unsuitable for further use. The
@environmentallawinstitute and @doyle inventoried many of the
by-products of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex that could pose
threats to human health and environmental safety.

Small inhalable particles emitted can damage short- and long-term human
respiratory function. Volatile organic compounds emanate from cracking
such as ground-level ozone, benzene, and toluene associated with
respiratory and other health ailments. Permitted in treated wastewater
to be discharged to the Ohio River are certain levels of benzene,
benzo(a)pyrene, and vinyl chloride that are established human
carcinogens.

Cracking also releases carbon dioxide, a gas that can absorb energy
within the infrared wavelengths. This energy is transferred by collision
with other molecules. Faster molecular motion produces heat. Trapped
heat from this action of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is the
"greenhouse effect" that has influenced the long-term warming of the
planet's overall temperature.

The Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit
[@commonwealthofpennsylvania2015], valid through 2019,[^15] for the
kinds and numbers of tons of annual emissions by the Complex listed in
Table 1.

[^15]: Reported to me was that a new permit is required when the Complex
    begins operating.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection required for
this first-of-its-kind facility in Pennsylvania complex environmental
reviews, approvals, and permits for new construction, remediation of
contamination from previous industrial activities on the property, and
operation. The Department keeps a running list of news on its website
(see @shellpea ) about the Complex, permits and approvals obtained for
the construction and operation of the facility, and
compliance/enforcement actions taken by government agencies to regulate
the Complex.

## How Well Understood is the  Potential <br> Economic Impact of Complex?

Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC made a complex, courageous, and
consequential financial decision to build and operate the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex. Shell says that the Complex will open sometime
in 2022 [@shrum2022a]. The Commonwealth's citizens also invest with
Shell in the Complex. Foregoing current and future tax expenditures by
the Commonwealth reduced Shell's start-up costs, will subsidize
purchases of ethane for cracking, and eliminates much of Shell's state
and local tax liability.

Although Shell and the Commonwealth invest jointly in the Complex, their
investment goals differ. Shell aims to sell plastic pellets from the
Complex for a profit. The Commonwealth wishes to benefit from the impact
the Complex could have on regional jobs, income, business activity, and
tax revenue.

Shell will review its balance sheets and earnings reports to judge its
yield from the Complex. The Commonwealth certainly can review regional
economic data that will emerge to account for the observed impact of the
operation of the Complex, although I am not aware of any impact
assessment plan. Shell-sponsored forecasts of the potential economic
impact of the Complex seem to have provided for the rationale for
accepting the Commonwealth's decision to invest in the Complex. However,
*potential* ≠ a *realized outcome*.

I conclude that reports about the forecasts made public by Shell might
have included conceptual orientations and methodological approaches that
left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of potential
economic impact. Therefore, some explanation of my assessment is
appropriate of the value of Shell's forecasts of potential impact to
justify Pennsylvania citizens' trust in investment in the Complex.

In this major section of this blog posting, I critically review a 2021
report about the potential regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex (portions of cover in Figure \@ref(fig:img-rm).
The preparation of this report, *Updated Economic Impact Analysis:
Petrochemical Facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania* [@clinton2021],
was supported by Shell Chemical Appalachia LLC. The importance of this
report is that some among the public and it representatives might
perceive that it satisfies questions about regional economic value of
the Complex.[^16]

[^16]: @sanzillo2020c reported that Robert Morris University professors
    completed an earlier report for Shell in 2014. Shell informed them
    "that the report is not 'externally available' (p. 4)," even though
    the unreleased report was quoted extensively by independent media
    sources. @sanzillo2020c concluded that "The company has clearly
    decided not to disclose basic information about its project---not
    even how much the plant will cost (p. 4)."

When the Robert Morris report[^17] was released in 2021, the report's
authors were identified as faculty members in the School of Business at
[Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/academics/schools/sbus).
Earlier similarly produced economic impact reports by the American
Chemistry Council appeared while the Pennsylvania legislature was
considering incentives through tax expenditures to aid the construction
and operation of the Complex. I believe that these Council reports share
nearly the same methodology and analytics, as well as some of the same
issues, evident in the Robert Morris report by @clinton2021. Dissection
of the Robert Morris report also can shed light on the American
Chemistry Council reports' validity, therefore.

[^17]: I will refer in the remainder of this blog posting to the report,
    *Updated Economic Impact Analysis: Petrochemical Facility in Beaver
    County, Pennsylvania,* as the "Robert Morris report." In making this
    assignment, I realize that I might promote the error of conflating
    the personal work of a team of professors with the official position
    of Robert Morris University. In 1940, the American Association of
    University Professors (AAUP), affirmed the "free search for truth
    and its free exposition" [@1940sta2006, para. 1] of faculty
    researchers. Faculty research findings are not necessarily
    university conclusions. As this independence of expression is
    executed, the AAUP enjoined faculty researchers that they "should be
    accurate at all times" [@1940sta2006, item 3 in "Academic Freedom"].
    I am not suggesting that the authors of the Robert Morris report hid
    behind an often-assumed cloak of endorsement from Robert Morris
    University itself or that their work was not accurate. Rather, my
    point is to separate Robert Morris University as a locus for this
    research from the methods chosen by the researchers and the findings
    they reached. The blending of the aims and conclusions of
    researchers with their employing institutions is common in
    discussion of the potential economic impact of Pennsylvania natural
    gas development and production. Rose Baker and I discussed problems
    created by referring to forecasts funded by the Marcellus Shale
    Coalition of the economic impact of Pennsylvania natural gas
    development and production as the "Penn State studies"
    [@passmore2011].

knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/rm-cover.png")
```

I structure my critical review of the Robert Morris report along three
lines:

-   *Summary and Reflection.* First, I summarize the Robert Morris
    report, accompanied by light annotation about some of the methods
    applied to generate the report.
-   *Issues.* Next, I identify three issues in the Robert Morris report
    that left the Commonwealth's citizens without clear evidence of the
    potential economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals
    Complex: classification of the industry accounting for impact,
    identification of Indirect Impact, and appropriateness of a 40-year
    forecast of impact.
-   *Next Steps.* Last, I describe briefly some ways that might prove
    useful for assessing any regional economic impact of the Complex. As
    far as I know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform such any
    impact assessment.

### The Robert Morris Report: A Summary and Reflection

#### Focus

Shell engaged Robert Morris faculty members "to provide an independent
analysis[^18] of the economic impact of the construction and operation
of the contemplated petrochemical facility" by examining "direct
economic changes in job creation and overall economic output, focusing
on the construction and operational phases of the Project. Additionally,
the multiplicative impacts of the Project are considered"
[@clinton2021b, p. 7].

[^18]: The Robert Morris report is the result of independent work by its
    authors, not by Shell. Front matter in the report underscores not
    only the independence of the authors, but also the separation of the
    report from Shell: "All work contained in this study expresses only
    the opinion of the authors and is the result of publicly available
    information. The results and conclusions are those of the authors,
    not those of Royal Dutch Shell plc or any of its affiliates
    [@clinton2021c, p. iii]." The report does not rise to the level of a
    what Shell describes as "forward-looking statement" [@shelltab,
    "Cautionary Note"] about its plans and operations.

#### Impact Estimation

The analytics behind the report rely on input-output modeling, a
data-based, computational, and most often prospective approach to
unwinding the impact of projects, events, and changes in local
economies. An input-output model accounts for goods and services that
are required as inputs by industries to produce outputs of goods and
services necessary to satisfy requirements for supplies to other
industries or for delivery directly to consumers [@miernyk1965].

Impact estimates computed for the Robert Morris report relied
exclusively on IMPLAN software [@economic2019] for input-output modeling
to analyze "publicly available information" [@clinton2021d, p. iii].
IMPLAN is described as the "gold standard" for economic impact analysis.
An essay I authored [@passmore2022b] describes the technical details of
input-output modeling.

Although the regional economic impacts of building the Pennsylvania
Petrochemicals Complex probably are substantial, construction nearly is
complete as I write this blog posting. I, therefore, exclude
construction impacts and, instead, emphasize the portions of the Robert
Morris report focused on operating the Complex. I also exclude from my
summary portions of the report that estimate the statewide impacts of
the Complex. @clinton2021 indicated that "Most of the impact for the
proposed Project is expected to occur in Beaver County, Pennsylvania and
SWPA [southwestern Pennsylvania]" (p. 10).

#### Geography of Potential Impact

The core of the Robert Morris report focused on Beaver County and, then,
on a 10-county region of southwestern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
counties comprised of Allegheny, Beaver, Armstrong, Butler, Fayette,
Green, Indiana, Lawrence, Westmoreland, and Washington form the
10-county region (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-tenc)).[^19] @clinton2021
constrained the analysis to these 10 counties even though, "It is
anticipated that border counties in Ohio and West Virginia will be
impacted" (p. 10).

[^19]: @clinton2021 reported that "Additionally, we specify the Multiple
    Region Input-Output (MRIO) model which recognizes the spillover
    effects across the regions of study" (p.10). If the MRIO model was
    used, the way that it was specified and the results it produced are
    not clear in the report. IMPLAN indicates "In an MRIO analysis, the
    Direct Effect in one region can trigger Indirect and Induced Effects
    in linked regions, thereby accounting for some of what would have
    been a leakage in a single-region analysis. This lack of
    documentation of use of MRIO in the analysis leading to the report
    opens questions about whether the southwestern Pennsylvania results
    were derived from separate analyses of the each of the 10 counties
    with the starting point for Complex employment. IMPLAN cautions
    against what they describe as a "mock MRIO" by doing an analysis of
    "the same event occurring in a smaller region and in a larger
    region, like a county and a state and then distributed the
    difference between the two as the effects that would occur in the
    rest of the state (i.e., the state less the county in which the
    direct effect actually took place). At best, this was a shaky
    methodology. However, since the development of domestic trade data
    and MRIO capabilities in 2008, this is no longer necessary and
    therefore is not an acceptable method!" [@slovachek].

```{r img-tenc, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra="class=external", fig.cap='*10-County Region in Southwestern, Pennsylvania.* <br> (Map created by David Passmore using online tool <br> at https://www.mapchart.net/usa-counties.html'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/PAmap.png")
```

@clinton2021 assumed workers from the 10-county region will fill 90% of
jobs at the Complex and that 40% to 75% of the people who fill the new
jobs will live in Beaver County (p. 13). These assumptions seems
reasonable.

My analysis of the flow of workers into and out of Beaver County in 2019
(Figure \@ref(fig:img-flowm)) demonstrates that about one-half of
workers in Beaver County also lived in the county and that another
one-half traveled from outside Beaver County to work in the county. At
the same time, almost 49,000 residents of Beaver County traveled to work
outside the county.

My analysis of distances from work to home for all Beaver County workers
in 2019 shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-flowm) reveals that one-half of
all Beaver County workers lived within 10 miles of their places of work.
Another one-quarter of Beaver County workers traveled from 10 to 24
miles from work to their places of residence. The remainder traveled
greater than 25 miles from work in Beaver County to home. Data not shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:img-flowm) revealed that almost two-thirds of
workers traveling 50 or more miles from work in Beaver County went to
homes north, northeast, and east of Beaver County. Also, 40% of workers
traveling home between 25 and 50 miles went to homes southeast of Beaver
County (i.e., from the direction of Westmoreland County).

One impediment to defining an economic region by geopolitical
boundaries, such as county lines, is the risk of misspecifying the
economic region expected to be affected by the Complex. An economic
region is a cohesive area in which commerce takes place. Of course,
administrative or geographical boundaries can define an economic region,
especially if governments govern commerce or terrain limits movement.
However, commerce rarely respects map lines or many other impediments.

Other factors can define the economic region for the Complex, such as
its laborshed (i.e., the region from which the facility draws its
commuting workers, as I have provided in Figures \@ref(fig:img-flowm)
and \@ref(fig:img-radar)) and proximal regional suppliers (i.e., firms
close enough geographically to the Complex to supply goods and
services). Perhaps a worthy approach moving forward will be to amend the
boundaries of the economic region affected by the Complex to reflect
local supply of goods, services, and labor. Such as approach might
properly include, for example, parts of Ohio or areas north of Beaver
County, or, perhaps, removal of Fayette or Green counties from the
economic region the Complex affects. Let the data that emerge after the
Complex begins operation guide establishment of the boundaries of the
economic region that the Complex affects.

#### Estimates of Potential Impact

Job numbers expected to be required during the operation of the complex
were the sole inputs into the IMPLAN software to initiate the estimates
in Table 1.[^20] Some assumptions stated in the report about job numbers
that formed the starting point for estimation:

[^20]: Many IMPLAN modeling efforts begin by asking "what if a certain
    number of jobs are added in an industry?" An alternative is to ask
    "what if the output of an industry increased by a number of millions
    of dollars?" In input-output modeling. these two approaches are
    equivalent. Adding jobs adds output to the economy by the dollar
    value of the product produced by each added worker (i.e., labor
    productivity). Adding output to the economy adds to number of jobs
    required to produce each dollar's worth of output (i.e., labor
    intensity). Either way the modeling is initiated, adding output from
    an industry to the economy pushes backward into the economy to
    require purchasing of additional supply from other industries and,
    in this way, generates additional jobs and income throughout the
    economy.

The authors reported that they analyzed the "Petroleum Refinery
operation" industry [@clinton2021e, p. 8-9] to calculate the potential
regional economic impact of the Complex. After excluding construction
and statewide impact from my consideration, I extracted from the Robert
Morris report and, then, recorded in Table 2 the potential economic
impacts of operating a petroleum refinery on Beaver County, on a
10-county southwestern Pennsylvania area, and resulting from 40 years of
refinery activity.

#### Measures of Potential Economic Impact

For the most part, definitions of components of economic impact reported
The Robert Morris report were not provided or cited in the Robert Morris
report. Some of these concepts and terms are drawn from definitions used
in national income and product accounting by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis [@nipahan2021; @glossarya]. Others are derived from the
language used around input-output analysis [@clouse].

The relationships and overlaps among some of the components of economic
impact reported in Table 2 are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-outp). The
components shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-outp) are from national income
and product accounting. The components are organized hierarchically into
overlapping categories.

```{r img-outp, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='*Relationships Among Some of the Components of Regional Economic Output, <br> Most of Which Are Estimated in the Robert Morris Report.*<br> (Image captured and recolored from https://bit.ly/IMPLANoutput)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://davidpassmore.net/blogd/img/output.png")
```

Definitions of components of impact displayed in Table 2 include:

-   *Labor income* equals employee compensation plus proprietors'
    income.\
    -   *Employee compensation* is the sum of employee wages and
        salaries and supplements to wages and salaries. Wages and
        salaries are measured on an accrual, or "when earned" basis,
        which may be different from the measure of wages and salaries
        measured on a disbursement, or "when paid" basis. Supplements to
        wages and salaries include employer contributions for employee
        pension and insurance funds and of employer contributions for
        government social insurance.\
    -   *Proprietor's income* is current--production income (including
        income in--kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of
        tax--exempt cooperatives. Fees of corporate directors are
        included in income of proprietors, but the imputed net rental
        income of owner--occupants of all dwellings is included in
        rental income of persons. Proprietors' income excludes dividends
        and monetary interest received by nonfinancial businesses along
        with rental incomes received by persons not primarily engaged in
        the real estate business. These incomes are included in
        dividends, net interest, and rental income of persons,
        respectively.\
-   *Value added* is labor income *plus* taxes paid on production and
    imports and other property income.
    -   *Taxes paid on production and imports*, accounted as a negative
        value, include include sales and excise taxes, customs duties,
        property taxes, motor vehicle licenses, severance taxes, other
        taxes, and special assessments.\
    -   *Other property income* includes consumption of fixed capital,
        corporate profits, and net of business current transfer
        payments. It also includes income derived from dividends,
        royalties, corporate profits, and interest income.\
-   *Total output* is the sum of value added plus intermediate output.
    The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis defines intermediate output as
    "Goods and services that are used in the production process of other
    goods and services and are not sold in final-demand markets"
    [@glossary]. Intermediate Inputs are purchases of non-durable goods
    and services such as energy, materials, and purchased services that
    are used for the production of other goods and services, rather than
    for final consumption. Purchases of intermediate goods are
    business-to-business transactions.\
-   *Jobs* equal the count of part-- and full--time jobs, including all
    federal, state, and local government employment, military
    employment, and self--employment. This definition does not count
    "in--kind work" without pay by family member as employment.

*State and local earned income taxes* were not calculated *inside* the
IMPLAN model, Instead, the authors of the Robert Morris report
calculated tax impacts *outside* the model using data *from* the model.
The authors explain:

> The project is expected to exert a substantial impact on state and
> local taxes. There will be a number of tax impacts such as income tax,
> property tax, and licenses and permits. The income tax is the most
> tractable. We assume a 3.07% state income tax rate for the
> Pennsylvania wage income and a 1% local rate. Given that labor income
> in the model includes both wages and benefits we assume that benefits
> are 34% of wages so that 75% of labor income would be taxed as wages
> and 25% would not be taxed because it relates to nontaxable benefits.
> [@clinton2021e, p. 15]

Total economic impacts on value added, labor income, and jobs are parsed
in panel I of Table 2 into direct, indirect, and induced components as
(using [definitions by IMPLAN](https://bit.ly/eff-def)):

-   *Direct impacts* are the initial effects on the economy of the
    Complex. For example, referencing Table 2, the number of direct of
    jobs in Beaver County is 240 to 450, depending on assumptions about
    the activity of the Complex. That is the range of the number of jobs
    that the Complex could possibly employ.\
-   *Indirect impacts* are the effects of purchases of supplies by the
    Complex from local industries. The range of jobs generated by the
    Complex indirectly in local supplying industries is between 267
    and 501. Some supplies are purchased outside Beaver County and,
    therefore, are not attributed to the impact of the Complex in the
    county.\
-   *Induced impacts* are effects of the regional economy that results
    from local spending of income earned by workers in the Complex and
    by workers in local industries that supply the Complex. The range of
    jobs induced by the Complex is between 270 and 494. Some of the
    income earned by workers at the Complex and workers in local
    supplying industries leaks outside the county.

The sum of direct, indirect and induced components in panel I of Table 2
is an estimate of the total potential impacts (depicted in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-multiply)) of the Complex on regional value added, labor
income, and jobs. Impacts-by-component, excluding taxes, were calculable
only for estimates in panel I of Table. In another blog posting, I
detail the technical aspects of calculating these impacts
(@passmore2022c, "Multipliers").

#### Did Economics Play a Role in the Assessment <br> of the Potential Economic Impact of the Complex?

Reading the Robert Morris report leads to a growing realization: This
report about economic impact describes an accounting exercise, not an
application of economics. The impressive technique of input-output
modeling won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1973 for Wassily
Leontief [@leontief1936, \@leontief1966], an economist who developed
theory and methods [@thesver] that became computationally tractable with
the advent of high-speed computing. Setting this impressive
methodological accolade aside, the chief difficulty with the Robert
Morris report -- and many other reports relying on IMPLAN -- is that it
assembles a brief of benefits while ignoring costs, the assembly of
which is key feature of economic analysis.

The John Locke Foundation is a firm critic of common input-output
modeling applications. The Foundation claimed [@economic2017a] that many
input-output modeling efforts are heavy on accounting, but light on
economics. In fact, many studies using input-output analysis consider
only benefits of a project, but fail to consider or model *any* costs of
a project. In this way, many technically complicated studies of economic
impact represent attempts to advocate a project, not to research full
impact, even though sophisticated tools of research are applied.

Of course, any new economic activity viewed without costs consistently
will demonstrate unalloyed benefits. Something is larger than nothing,
right? The "big-benefits-with-few-costs" approach is compelling to
legislators, policy-makers, and funding agencies seeking to convince the
public that projects, events, or changes are indispensable for economic
growth and community revitalization [@sanders2015].

The John Locke Foundation observed that input-output modeling is so
often conducted "by professional consulting firms who are hired by
interest groups to do the studies. Furthermore, seldom do those who
actually perform the studies have formal training in economics. Instead
their expertise is in using...proprietary [input-output] models
[@economic2017a]". I am not asserting by quoting this sentiment from the
John Locke Foundation that the authors of the Robert Morris report
lacked training and expertise in economics. Their biographies reveal
that they are seasoned economic analysts. Instead, I believe that the
Robert Morris report represents plainly an assertion of benefits without
factoring in costs.

Ignoring costs and other modes of failure to think ahead to consider
full economic consequences prompted Frédéric Bastiat, French economist
best known for his journalistic writing in favor of free trade and the
economics of Adam Smith, to write in his last published pamphlet in 1850
that:

> In the economic sphere an act, a habit, an institution, a law produces
> not only one effect, but a series of effects. Of these effects, the
> first alone is immediate; it appears simultaneously with its cause; it
> is seen. The other effects emerge only subsequently; they are not
> seen; we are fortunate if we foresee them.

> There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one:
> the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good
> economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and
> those effects that must be foreseen. [@bastiat1964]

#### Attributing Responsibility for Assessing Potential Impact

I wish to clearly attribute responsibility to the political and
government representatives of Pennsylvania citizens, not to Shell or the
authors of the Robert Morris report, for failing to exert due diligence
over the evidence necessary to decide to expend tax revenue to support
the operation of the Complex. The problem created by this failure
probably outweighs any technical issues that might exist in the Robert
Morris report.

I emphasize that Shell and the authors of the Robert Morris report were
not compelled to offer a report that would include costs estimates as
well as benefits for the citizens of Pennsylvania and their
representatives. The problems, I believe, lies with lack of due
diligence by Commonwealth representatives. Instead, I suggest that the
Commonwealth should have sought, either through a Commonwealth analysis
or from an independent contractor, a report that displayed for the
public the costs along with the benefits before expending tax revenue to
partner with a private enterprise investment.

No evidence is available that public representatives of the
Commonwealth's citizens made their own independent assessment of the
regional economic impact of the Complex. Instead, they accepted, mostly
uncritically, the economic impact estimates and forecasts prepared for
Shell and by other petrochemical industry associations to make their
decisions about tax expenditures for the Complex.

To be sure, Shell did not pretend to support an economic impact report
to meet the public's needs for information. I can find nowhere in the
report or in Shell's public statements that the report was intended to
thoroughly inventory the costs and benefits of building and operating
the Complex for the public. As a private enterprise with shareholders
should be, Shell was focused on its own interests. We should not
conflate Shell's interests with the public interest. I do not make that
assertion cynically but fully believe that firms like Shell should
pursue free-market self-interest. Every stakeholder in these
transactions needs to look after its own interests. Who was looking
after the interests of Pennsylvania citizens?

Modeling efforts that produce analyses like those reported by the Robert
Morris authors usually run into discrepancies between the data needed
and the data available for analysis. IMPLAN and other input-output
modeling tools rely heavily on government data about economic activity.
Governments usually release data not about firms but are agglomerated
from private data provided by firms into clusters of information in
categories that do not identify firms. Sometimes this discrepancy
between what analysts want and need requires compromises, fitting a few
square pegs in round holes and getting a result "near to the truth."

Construction of a statement of the regional economic benefits of the
Complex required many assumptions and analysis decisions and
compromises. I do not know the terms of Shell's support for the Robert
Morris report, but I suppose that the Robert Morris authors produced a
technical report that satisfied Shell's interests. The authors do not
assert that the report is meant to serve the public's interest. The
report is not designed primarily to serve the entire interests of
Commonwealth citizens.

I assess that the Robert Morris authors of the report handled well many
technical constraints imposed by input-output modeling with IMPLAN and
limitations levied by the regional data they analyzed. The report shows
evidence of deft craftsmanship in conducting input-output analysis with
IMPLAN. The authors seem well-qualified in education and experience to
tackle this impact analysis. I base my assessment on my approximately 45
years of experience with input-output modeling and IMPLAN software,
during which I completed about 130 economic impact studies.

But perhaps the most striking realization about the reception of the
Robert Morris report and the American Chemical Society's reports is that
the Commonwealth did not feel the need to commission its own analysis of
the potential economic impact of the Complex. The Robert Morris report
and the American Chemical Society's seemed sufficient to satisfy public
representatives and officials that the public's interests were served by
making tax expenditures on the Complex.

### Three Issues Evident in the Robert Morris Report

I identify and discuss three issues evident in the Robert Morris report.
These issues mostly evolve from technical matters that I believe affect
the validity of the report to inform the public about the potential
regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. I
focus on these issues because the Robert Morris report seems to be the
only evidence of potential economic impact that reinforced public
decision-making to expend tax revenue on the Complex.

I am not under the illusion that identifying these three issues with the Robert Morris report changes anything. The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will spin up soon. The chemistry will cook. The plastic resin will be nibbled into nurdles. Pointing out technical matters about an economic impact report has little critical standing next to what appears to be a significant lapse of fiduciary duty by elected and appointed public officials meant to represent Pennsylvania citizens. Pennsylvania taxpayers became unwitting investors in a project, the Complex, for which the social costs were neither organized nor delineated by their representatives, who allowed the entity seeking the investment to define the project's social benefits. 

#### Classification of the Industry Accounting for Impact

The Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is classified in the "Petroleum
Refineries" industry in the Robert Morris report. *I **argue that,
because the primary product of the Complex is polyethylene pellets,
output from the Complex probably is best classified within the "Plastic
Resin Manufacturing" industry.*** Differences in the classification of
the industry in which the Complex is classified are important because
data from a different industries likely would yield different impact
estimates. IMPLAN notes that, although some industries are comparable,

##### The Complex Extrudes Plastic Resin; It is Not a Refinery

Abstracting from Figure \@ref(fig:img-processF), the flow between the
ethane cracking process to the polymerization is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-smallpr). Ethylene is generated by cracking ethane at the
Complex and becomes an input for polymerization. Ethylene is not an
output of the Complex for sale to customers. Polymerized plastic pellets
form the major output, the major product, of the Complex. Analysis of
the Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex as a petroleum refinery is an
error. *One more time:* The Complex sells polymerized plastic pellets
from ethylene made at the complex. Ethylene made at the Complex is not a
product of the Complex. It is an input to another process at the
Complex.

Consider. You own a company that makes cans of noodles and meatballs in
a tomato sauce. The company makes a lot of tomato sauce by processing
tomatoes. Tomatoes are not the product. Tomatoes are one input to the
product. Your company makes meatballs using meat purchased from cattle
farms. Meatballs are not the product. They are an input to the product.
The company cooks noodles made on site. Noodles are not the product.
Noodles are an input to the product. When mixed and canned,
tomato sauce, meatballs, and noodles form the final product your company
sells to consumers. Your company is not a tomato sauce, meatball, or
noodle manufacturer. Your company sells cans of spaghetti and meatballs
in tomato sauce to wholesalers as a processed food product. The wholesalers distribute the canned product to a retailer. A mama might buy a can to put in her son's thermos for a school lunch. You are in
the Spaghetti Canning industry, not in a tomato, meatball, or noodle industry.

##### The Authors of the Robert Morris Report Faced Analytic Compromises

The authors of the Robert Morris report had to shoehorn their analytic problem into the IMPLAN framework. Here is the compromise required to select the Petroleum Refineries
industry analyzed by @clinton2021 rather than Petrochemical
Manufacturing:

> "Within the IMPLAN application model, the 'event' selected for the
> operations phase of the economic impact is category number 154,
> 'Petroleum Refiners'....While the [IMPLAN] dataset includes a
> classification for 159 Petrochemical Manufacturing, there is no
> multiplier and no underlying data to model the economic impact on
> since there is currently no such activity within the state of
> Pennsylvania. Therefore, the nearest analogous industry and multiplier
> to the previous study, Petroleum Refineries, was selected. (p. 8-9)

This attempt to get the best fit of available government income and
product accounting data with the IMPLAN application is a common
compromise that required professional judgment by the authors of the
Robert Morris report. IMPLAN contains 546 industries for analysis that
are agglomerated from thousands of industry categories from which
federal statistical agencies obtains and classifies data using the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Classified by NAICS are establishments by the primary goods or services
they produce [@whatisa]. The @northam says that "Economic units that
have similar production processes are classified in the same industry,
and the lines drawn between industries demarcate, to the extent
practicable, differences in production processes" (p. 3). Virtually all
statistics captured about economic activity by the U.S. Census Bureau,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other government agencies are classified
by NAICS codes. According to an online FAQ about the NAICS coding system
[@northam]:

> NAICS is a 2-- through 6--digit hierarchical classification system,
> offering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a
> series of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in
> the code signify greater classification detail. The first two digits
> designate the economic sector, the third digit designates the
> subsector, the fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth
> digit designates the NAICS industry, and the sixth digit designates
> the national industry. The 5--digit NAICS code is the level at which
> there is comparability in code and definitions for most of the NAICS
> sectors across the three countries participating in NAICS (the United
> States, Canada, and Mexico). The 6--digit level allows for the United
> States, Canada, and Mexico each to have country-specific detail. A
> complete and valid NAICS code contains six digits.

Under NAICS, an industry is comprised of a group of establishments
engaged in the same or similar types of economic activity. An establishment is a single location where business is conducted or where services/operations are performed.^[If employees normally do not work at a single physical location, the establishment is identified by the main office that supervises employees’ activities or is the base at which employees carry out these activities.] In general, accounting for the  production flow moves from establishments within firms and, then, is aggregated to industries.

Industry output is produced by firms, which are for-profit business organizations, such as a corporations, limited liability companies, or partnership. A number of firms can contribute to an industry. Industries are not mutually exclusive collections of firms. Separate industries might include some of the same firms. Also, firms might own or manage multiple establishments at which industry production occurs. 

Having an
establishment classified under more than one NAICS code is possible if
the establishment makes more than one product. For instance, at one
time, Kodak made cameras, but the firm also produced chemicals. In this
way, an industry does not hold firms inclusively within a single NAICS
code, and single NAICS codes do not do not classify firms exclusively.

IMPLAN provides a crosswalk between their 546-industry classifications
and NAICS codes (a spreadsheet at @implan contains the crosswalk). Many
thousands more NAICS codes exist than IMPLAN industry classifications.
As a result, each IMPLAN industry represents a large cluster of NAICS
industries. Inspection and comparison of the many NAICS CODE associated with IMPLAN
industry 154, Petroleum Refineries, and IMPLAN industry 159,
Petrochemical Manufacturing reveals that IMPLAN's Petroleum Refineries industry (IMPLAN
154) does not point to any ethylene production. Descriptions of NAICS
industries under Petrochemical Manufacturing include products made from
natural gas liquids. However, the authors of the Robert Morris report
selected IMPLAN 154, Petroleum Refineries, for analysis, even though it
is not a good match for the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, for
these reasons that they give:

> While the dataset [for IMPLAN] includes a classification for 159
> Petrochemical Manufacturing, there is no multiplier and no underlying
> data to model the economic impact on since there is currently no such
> activity within the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, the nearest
> analogous industry and multiplier to the previous study, Petroleum
> Refineries, was selected. [@clinton2021f, p. 8-9]


##### Classifying the Complex in the Petroleum Refineries Industry is an Error

Substitution of available data about petroleum refineries for
unavailable data about plastic resin manufacturing from hydrocarbons
(which includes ethylene production) is an error. NAICS definitions of
these industries show that these two industries are different:

-   *NAICS 324110, Petroleum Refineries,* "comprises establishments
    primarily engaged in refining crude petroleum into refined
    petroleum. Petroleum refining involves one or more of the following
    activities: (1) fractionation; (2) straight distillation of crude
    oil; and (3) cracking" [@definitia].

-   *NAICS 325110, Plastic Material and Resin Manufacturing,* "comprises
    establishments primarily engaged in (1) manufacturing acyclic (i.e.,
    aliphatic) hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene
    made from refined petroleum or liquid hydrocarbons and/or (2)
    manufacturing cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene,
    polystyrene, ethylene, ethyl benzene, and acumen made from refined
    petroleum or liquid hydrocarbons" [@definiti].

Cracking is, indeed,part of NAICS 324110. However, NAICS codes define
industries in which a product is manufactured for other industries (what
is called "intermediate production") or sold directly for personal
consumption, business investment, government purchases, and exports
(what is called "final demand"). The Pennsylvania Petrochemical Complex
does not sell its cracked ethane to other firms. It does not sell
ethylene to fulfill final demand in the economy. Rather the ethylene
made at the Complex is transferred within the complex to the next and
final step in the production flow of the Complex -- for plastic resin
production.

A practical argument often is made in IMPLAN analyses that using a proxy
industry deemed close in structure and production to a target industry
is a practical solution to this classification problem and is all that
seems possible within the data limitations. Yet, in the case of the
Complex, the proxy and target industries not only are quite different in
products, but the proxy and the target industries employ different
processes and draw in different patterns of resources.

For just one example of the difference between the proxy and target
industries for the Robert Morris report, using national data from the
U.S. Census Bureau for 2020 [@u.s.bureauoflaborstatistics2021], NAICS
324110, Petroleum Refineries, generated \$7.2 million of output per
worker, while NAICS 325110, Plastic Resin Manufacturing, produced \$2.1
million of output per worker. These values are crude measures that do
not reflect official productivity statistics and probably are
inappropriate guides to output per worker in the Pennsylvania economy
and that are anticipated from the Complex. However, if the output per
worker in the proxy industry analyzed in the Robert Morris report is 3.4
times the value for target industry. If this difference in scale is
valid, then the Robert Morris report contains inflated estimates of
value added, labor income, and taxes.[^21]

[^21]: Refer to Table 2 to explore further what appears to be very high dollar
    of value added per direct worker.

##### Complex Analytic Alternatives Were Possible

The authors of the Robert Morris report had analytic options beyond
using a proxy industry for the target industry. The IMPLAN database can
be customized by adding an industry that does not exist yet or using a
proxy region similar to the region of interest [@lucas]. Also possible
is adding a new industry to a region by specifying a spending pattern
for the new industry [@clouseb]. To follow these options, an analyst
would require financial data about the Complex's output and supply
structure, which Shell, I am sure, would like to keep confidential.

#### Identification of Indirect and Induced Impacts

Plastic resin manufacturing will directly support jobs at the Complex
that pay wages to workers and extract wage taxes for governments. Also,
the Complex will purchase goods and services from suppliers, which will indirectly multiply business value, income, jobs, and taxes
beyond the Complex. In addition, pay received by workers in the Complex
and by workers in the firms that supply the Complex will induce
consumer goods and services purchases. ***The direct, indirect, and
induced impacts of plastic resin manufacturing differ from
impacts that could be created by "petroleum refining."*** This issue is a corollary to the first issue that I identified -- the industry in which the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is misidentified as "Petroleum Refineries." 

The Complex will purchase non-durable goods and services from suppliers. I believe that Complex is likely to have a unique production function -- that is, the recipe of inputs necessary to produce the output of the Complex. Ethane cracking will co-locate with resin production, probably reducing the costs incurred by a facility that must purchase ethylene externally for delivery. Pipeline or container transportation requires extra expenses for cryogenic containers or pipelines under high pressure to keep ethylene in a dense fluid state rather than as a vapor. The Complex will generate, rather than purchase, its own electricity. Shell has indicated how much natural gas it will purchase through the Falcon Pipeline and how much water it might use, but the amount and kind of other inputs to the Complex remain unknown. Also unknown is the proportion of inputs Shell will purchase locally in Beaver County or the southwestern Pennsylvania region. 

Because neither the production function for the Complex nor the proportion of inputs satisfied locally are not known, the indirect economic impact of the Complex
is not clear. As a result, the potential exists for over- or under-statement
of the total economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.
Also, if the primary product of the Complex is, as I assert, best
classified as plastic resin, not ethylene, then misspecification of the
full economic impact of the Complex shown in the Robert Morris report is
possible. 

#### Questionable Validity of a 40-Year Forecast of Impact

Forecasted in the Robert Morris report is the potential 40-year economic
impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.[^22] IMPLAN, the
developer of software applied to produce the Robert Morris report,
cautions against long-term forecasting due to various limitations of the
static input-output model programmed by IMPLAN in representing the
dynamics operating over time in the working economy [@datateam2022, "Why
Isn't There Any Forecasting"].

[^22]: A 40-year span of life of the Complex might seem like a rather
    long period of plant service for which to estimate economic impact.
    @pearson2010 concluded that the average life of ethylene plants in
    North America and Europe will be around 30 years considering the
    anticipated effects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion,
    carburization-oxidation, and possible critical plant failure,
    although innovations could extend petrochemical and chemical plants
    well beyond their original anticipated design life. An important
    question is whether sustaining the Complex's product and resource
    markets is possible for as long as the infrastructure for the
    Complex is viable.

***I conclude that these 40-year estimates of impact constitute an
extension of static input-output modeling, software, and data beyond
their limitations.*** The economy of even a small region is constantly
in flux and does not remain static, especially over a 40-year future
period. IMPLAN notes that

> "To make a projection of what the economy will look [requires
> prediction] of all the demands for consumption...and [to] know all the
> new commodities and technologies that will be available. Local
> availability of resources to meet that demand would also need to be
> known." [@datateam2022, "Why Isn't There Any Forecasting"]

Absolute and relative prices remain static in IMPLAN's equations,
although dynamic prices are part of natural economic change --
especially when considered over a 40-year forecast period. Also assumed
in IMPLAN is that the technology to produce an industry's output will
not change, a fanciful notion about the future of modern production
processes. The 40-year forecasts of economic impact displayed in the
Robert Morris report were prominent in public discussion of the Complex
in the popular and environmental press. The forecasts attempt to portray
the sustainable impact of the Complex. The economic model and data were
not designed or suitable for long-term economic forecasting.

### Next Steps

Last, I describe briefly ways that remain for documenting the full
regional economic impact of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex.
These ways do not include replicating the Robert Morris report after the
Complex starts operations. The Robert Morris report is filed. Shell's
ship already has sailed. Barring any significant impediments, the
Complex will open. And, for right or wrong, the Commonwealth has
codified its commitment to investment in the Complex through
legislation. Everything is moving forward.

Time to look forward to using extant or new data to attribute regional
economic changes to the emerging activity of the Complex. Especially
important will be efforts to incorporate measures of the social costs of
the Complex into any future assessment.

#### Follow the Data

Eric de Place, a research fellow at the Ohio River Valley Institute,
urged in a 2021 interview, "As the cracker facility opens, and as it
shifts to actually producing polyethylene, let's continue to look back
at the track record on the ground and compare it to the promises and see
whether economic growth happens or not" [@scott2021, para. 8]. This
assessment could be structured around regional economic data before and
after the start-up of the Complex and on a comparison with comparable
economic regions without an ethane cracker. A necessity will be to draw
on innovations in the creative and complex design of natural
experiments[^23] to make these comparisons valid and fair. As far as I
know, the Commonwealth does not plan to perform such an assessment.

[^23]: Assessing the impact of the operation of the Complex is a complex
    technical problem in research design. Pre- and post-cracker
    comparisons of economic measures are possible. However, drawing
    causal connections between the ethane cracker intervention and pre-
    and post-operation states are complicated by the impossibility of
    random assignment of ethane cracker operations and the common
    threats to the validity of before-and-after studies. So-called
    "quasi-experimental" research designs [@shadish2001] are best-suited
    to control these design problems. For instance, interrupted
    time-series models [@shadish2001a, p. 175] of pre and post
    differences between the operation of the Complex are possible
    candidates for the Complex impact design. Propensity score
    adjustments [@austin2011] are possible for making "fair" comparisons
    of economic growth in the location of the Complex with similar
    communities absent a petrochemical operation. More on this research
    design problem in subsequent blog postings.

#### Weigh Costs, Especially of By-Products, as Well as Benefits

Any future assessment of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex's
economic impact should include *costs, not just benefits*. In
particular, such an assessment should calculate the cost exacted of
by-products from the Complex. Again, a by-product is a material produced
as a residual of, or incidental to, the production process. In an
accounting sense, by-products are associated with costs, not revenue.
The @environmentallawinstitute2018 and @doyle identified by-products of
the Complex that are considered hazardous by the World Health
Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and other agencies.

Recent reviews of research by @aguilar-gomez2022 highlighted the
substantial costs of pollution in terms of health, worker productivity,
crime, and decision-making from outdoor [@aguilar-gomez2022], indoor
[@duflo2008], and water [@schwarzenbach2010] sources even though
remarkable improvements in environmental quality have occurred in the
U.S. over several decades [@currie]. Nevertheless, low-income and
minority households often are concentrated in more highly polluted
regions and, consequently, suffer higher rates of age- and
cause-specific morbidity and mortality [@currie2020].

Some public statements about the Complex tend to separate the economic
impact of the Complex from concerns about the effects of its by-products
on public health as though the two realms of evidence are related only
by topic. The Complex often is discussed in fiscal terms. However,
significant by-products of the Complex often are addressed in the
language of epidemiology, medicine, and biostatistics. This separation
downgrades the perceived financial and economic consequences of
hazardous by-products, especially those by-products rarely seen or
smelled.[^24] Some synthesis of these approaches is desirable in future
assessments of the Complex. The concepts and tools of economic analysis
might present a path for this synthesis.

[^24]: David Foster Wallace in *This is Water* tells a little didactic
    parable about how the most obvious and important realities are often
    those that are hardest to see: "There are these two young fish
    swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the
    other way, who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys, how's the
    water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then
    eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, 'What the
    hell is water?' [@wallace2009a, pp. 3-4]."

#### Account for By-Products as Potential Negative Externalities

Identifying by-products as *externalities*, a concept used in economics, is
a common way to account for their impact. An externality exists when
producing or consuming a good cause an impact on third parties not
directly involved in the production or consumption transaction.
Externalities are classified as either positive or negative. A negative
externality results in costs that are not paid by the producer or
consumer but rather by a third party.

The Complex could create negative externalities by cracking ethane and making plastic resin
that, incidental to the process, could compromise the health of
third-party Pennsylvania citizens and damage the greater Pittsburgh
environment. One response to negative externalities is to charge fees
for production permits that are high enough to cover the expected
lifetime costs created by the externality. The Complex obtains permits
for the Commonwealth's Department of Environmental for specific amounts
and kinds of emissions or discharges. Unknown is whether these fees
cover the total costs of externalities.

More problem-focused than permit fees is the use of so-called
"cap-and-trade" government regulatory programs designed to limit, or
cap, the total level of emissions of certain chemicals, particularly
carbon dioxide [@howcap]. Firms that surpass the cap are taxed, while
companies that cut their emissions may sell or trade unused credits. In
April 2022, Pennsylvania entered the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,
a controversial multistate cap-and-trade program to reduce CO~2~, but
only affecting electric power plants (see [25 PA. CODE CH.
145](https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/RGGI/2022/RGGIinPABulletin_4222022.pdf)).
Some criticisms of cap-and-trade programs involve assertions that, on
the one hand, the cap on emission usually is set too high and that, on
the other hand, the program eliminates jobs [@mcdevitt2020]. I am not
aware of any plans to integrate the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex
into a cap-and-trade framework.

Another approach is to collect a "Pigouvian" tax[^25] that pays for the
consequences of the negative externality on independent third parties
and can dampen the manufacture of a good generating the externality by
raising the cost of its production. Pigouvian taxes shift the costs from
society back to the producers of these externalities. The aim, also, is
to eliminate market distortions of artificially low production costs
caused by passing some costs along to an innocent third party, often the
public. Without a way of accounting for externalities associated with
the Complex, costs are "kicked down the road" to future generations of
Pennsylvanians. A familiar outcome to many Pennsylvania citizens and
regional governments, isn't it, in the history of Pennsylvania fossil
fuel development and production?

[^25]: A Pigouvian tax takes its name from Arthur Pigou, the English
    economist who contributed to theory and understanding of
    externalities.

The amount of the Pigouvian tax should equal the cost of the harmful
externality, but calculating these costs is complex and nearly
impossible with any precision. I certainly realize, though, that the
total costs of the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex will prove
challenging to estimate. Even so, any estimate of the full economic
impact of the Complex should include public, social costs, especially
costs imposed from by-products.

Measuring the public, social costs of the Complex are prerequisites to,
even if difficult to measure, additional regulation and permitting, a
cap-and-trade approach, or establishing a Pigouvian tax to limit or
compensate for any externalities the Complex will generate. Even if
these three approaches prove impractical, some method for dealing with
negative externalities is necessary

## My Brief Sermon as a Postscript

I hope that this blog posting serves as a cautionary tale about review
of proposals for the use of public monies to subsidize innovation by
private enterprises. The case for public subsidies often rests solely on
the perception of the economic benefits of the innovation to the public.
But, proposals touting benefits only present merely a one-sided
argument. Seldom identified and analyzed are the total costs, risks, and
uncertainties that the public must bear when deciding to expend current
or potential tax revenue.

Consider how peculiar the request is to allocate public funds for
private innovation. Rarely are major financial decisions made by
businesses without balancing the benefits of innovation or change
against its costs. Similarly, the investment of public funds in private
innovation is a significant financial decision made by elected and
appointed public representatives. Yet, decisions to use public funds for
private innovation often do not undergo the same financial scrutiny
invoked by businesses.

Would a business make an investment decision without perpending costs as
well as benefits? Failure of a business to calculate a set of full pros
and cons of a financial proposition -- what Benjamin Franklin described
as calculating a moral or prudential algebra[^26] -- might result in
charges of financial malpractice. Shareholders of private enterprises
would take a dim view of willy-nilly investments based on benefits
without considering costs. So, why shouldn't the public demand a similar
benefit/cost calculus in any transaction made by a government that
expends scarce tax revenue gathered in trust from citizens? Where is the
due diligence for the Commonwealth's citizens if evidence solely about
benefits, absent costs, of public investment is pitched only by the
anticipated recipients of the funds?

[^26]: See a September 19, 1772 letter from Franklin to chemist Joseph
    Priestley [@franklin1817]. He advises Priestley to engage a moral or
    prudential algebra by listing the pros and cons of a decision and
    reflecting on the alternatives over time before deciding.

Businesses in market economies act to accomplish what is best for their
shareholders. Fiercely minimizing costs...profit by generating greater
revenue from operations than expenses...maximizing shareholder value.
Commonwealth citizens also have the right to expect that their
representatives follow their fiduciary duty to always act with the
public's best interests in mind. The Commonwealth manages tax
expenditures to profit the welfare of its citizens. Tax expenditures by
the Commonwealth should yield a stream of benefits for citizens that at
least equals expenditures. Without these motivations, neither businesses
nor governments are feasible and ultimately sustainable.

## My Point of View {.appendix}

I do not mean this blog posting to advocate or denounce, take a position
*pro* or *con* about, the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, although
my narrative in this posting carries a critical and evaluative tone.
Instead, I wrote this blog posting to document and clarify the meanings
I attached to the political (somewhat) and economic (more so) history,
status, and future of the Complex. Writing this blog posting was
essential to me because, as E. M. Forster, English fiction writer,
essayist, and librettist, reputedly once wrote, "How do I know what I
think until I see what I say?"

I certainly tried to keep you in mind, dear reader, as I composed this
blog posting. However, my primary motivation behind this posting was
selfishly on my own learning. If this blog posting had been written with
readers as my primary audience, it would have been tighter, contained
fewer asides, and eschewed deep and turgid cul-de-sacs of vocabulary and
argument. But I wrote it for myself. Therefore, I did not feel
constrained to reduce my word count, to "get to the point" quicker, or
to genuflect toward *de rigeur* authors and their arguments bullying us
as I might if I had been forced to write for an academic journal while
in a state of dread anticipating the pontificating, pointy, and deadly
attacks from a demonic "reviewer #2" [@guillet2020].

So, there you have it. Like Bill Belichick, New England Patriots head
coach and general manager, often tells reporters, "It is what it is." My
ride. I just picked you up as a hitcher.
