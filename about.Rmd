These NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived since 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher education for 51 years. Additional details about my background, experiences, and accomplishments <a href="https://davidpassmore.net" title="Passmore bio" target="_blank">are available elsewhere</a>.

I write these NOTES in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" title="RMarkdown">RMarkdown</a> code in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" title="RStudio">RStudio</a> using blogging tools provided in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank" title="R">R programming</a> package titled <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distill/index.html" target="_blank" title="distill package">`distill`</a>. I render the blog in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="html in Wikipedia">html</a> from the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to <a href="https://github.com/davidpassmore" target="_blank" title="Passmore GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>, from which it is served publicly through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_nameL" target="_blank" title="domain name in Wikipedia">domain name</a>, `davidpassmore.github.io/blog/`.

These NOTES cover a wide variety of topics that reflect the range of ideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit with my computers at a table in front of the large windows that look over trees, birds, and daily neighborhood activities from our 4th floor condo. 

I live my days as a retired person. I rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt to follow some monastic way. No, see it as a quiet time, an opportunity to organize and prepare, and a chance to have a few accomplishments before the rest of the world starts moving. I meet over my cup of morning coffee with long-time friends on Zoom from 6:30 to 7:30 am on Mondays through Saturdays. 

The remainder of my time on most days is spent on projects selected from too many to do. Sometimes I video conference with friends and collaborators across the world. I am in a sleep research study that requires that I get five hours of sleep per night, so I am asleep by 11:00 pm. Between rising and finally going to sleep, I do the purchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking, laundering, medicating, cleaning, banking, and so forth.
