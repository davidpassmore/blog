#### **I am [DAVID L. PASSMORE](me.html).** 

My NOTES originate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I have lived since 2020. I was a professor at Penn State for 41 years and in higher education for 51 years. Additional details about my background, experiences, and accomplishments [are available elsewhere](me.html)</a>.

#### **how these NOTES are rendered**

I write and code these NOTES  in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" title="RMarkdown">RMarkdown</a> syntax in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" title="RStudio">RStudio</a> using blogging tools provided in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank" title="R">R programming</a> package titled <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distill/index.html" target="_blank" title="distill package">`distill`</a>. I render the blog in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="html in Wikipedia">html</a> from the RMarkdown code. Then, I push the html to <a href="https://github.com/davidpassmore" target="_blank" title="Passmore GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>, from which it is served publicly through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" target="_blank" title="domain name in Wikipedia">domain name</a>, `davidpassmore.github.io/blog/`. I do not implement cookies and other tracking tools with this blog site, except to count user visits through Google Analytics.

#### **what's here?**

These NOTES span topics that reflect the range of ideas, learnings, and challenges that I encounter daily as I sit  at a table with my computers in front of large windows that look over trees, birds, and daily neighborhood activities from our 4th-floor condo in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

Motivating these NOTES is, of course, a hope to engage with others. But, perhaps more primary is the need for clarify meanings I attach to my perceptions of events, activities, and experiences. After all, as E. M. Forster, English fiction writer, essayist and librettist, reputedly once wrote, "How do I know what I think until I see what I say?‚Äù

I ran a blog at the now out-of-service domain, *motime.com*, during the early 2000s. I retrieved some of my longer postings to this former blog from The *Wayback Machine* at https://archive.org. I re-posted a few of these essays here as NOTES' postings.  

#### **how I engage**

I live my life as a retired person.

I rise at 4:00 am daily. Early rising is not my attempt to follow some monastic way. No, see it as a quiet time, an opportunity to organize and prepare, and a chance to have a few accomplishments before the rest of the world starts moving. I meet over my cup of morning coffee with long-time friends on a Zoom meeting from 6:30 to 7:30 am on Mondays through Saturdays.

I spend the remainder of my time on most days on projects selected from too many to do. Sometimes I hold video conferences with friends and collaborators worldwide to gain insights into issues and solutions to problems. I swim almost daily at the [wonderful pool at the Squirrel Hill Jewish Community Center](https://jccpgh.org/sports/aquatics/squirrel-hill/) in Pittsburgh, that is so close to Mr. Fred Rogers' former residence. It is good to be in the neighborhood.

I am in a sleep research study requiring slightly five hours of sleep per night, so I am asleep by 10:40 pm. Between rising and finally going to sleep, I do the purchasing, shopping, bill-paying, cooking, laundering, medicating, cleaning, banking, and so forth to help my wife, Alice.

*Who doth ambition shun and loves to live in the sun....*

#### **contacts with me**

Friends, I am similar to a gated community.

Send an email to me using the email address: `dlp AT davidpassmore dot net`. I take *iMsgs* and *SMS messages* at `dlp@psu.edu`. My *Twitter* handle is `@DLPPassmore`, where I am available publicly. I also run *Slack* teams for my former students and family. In these student and family teams, I typically am available instantly.

Although I have placeholder accounts on many social media apps, I do not do in any depth the *FaceBook*s or the *LinkedIn*s like the kids do. So, not much of me is available on those apps.

The telephone? Nah. I seldom pick up, except for family or for calls from close associates. Calling me without leaving a message results in number blocking.[^1] I *do* use Instagram, but I am only deeply hidden and accessible by family.

[^1]: Please note: my car warranty is as I like it; my grandchildren do not require me to bail them out of jail; the Internal Revenue Service is not trying to reach me urgently; I will never own a timeshare, nor, I guarantee, would you want me to.

I live in a secure building. So, instead of making direct threats to me face-to-face, post any expressions of unhappiness and ill-will to me via email or Twitter, where I will incorporate good ideas^[even those ideas I never considered or initially might seem out-of-sync with my settled patterns] into my life flow. Or, instead, I will press flush and exhaust you to float into the vast plasma and on to the cold, dark corners of my universe.
